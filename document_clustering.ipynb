We are deeply grateful to the alumni and friends who include us in their philanthropic priorities each year. Gifts of any amount are sincerely appreciated, have a tremendous impact, and are easy to make. You can use our online giving form to make a one-time or recurring gift using your credit card. Options for giving through EFT or appreciated securities (stocks, bonds or mutual funds) are also available. Checks are received by the University of Illinois Foundation at 1305 West Greet Street, MC-386, Urbana, IL 61801. Simply include your designation to CS @ ILLINOIS on the memo line and in your correspondence with the check. Establish an Endowment An endowment is an investment fund that offers you a naming opportunity and the satisfaction that your gift will continue to give in perpetuity. When an endowment fund is established, the principal of the fund is never used; the endowment provides a steady source of funds, based on the interest income it generates. This creates a meaningful and lasting legacy for donors in partnership with CS @ ILLINOIS. The most popular endowment fund opportunities include: faculty chair, professorship, or fellow; research fund; graduate fellowship/assistantship; lecture series; and undergraduate scholarship. Include CS @ ILLINOIS in Your Estate Plans Deferred gifts are the result of careful planning that integrates your charitable gift into your overall financial, tax, and estate-planning objectives to maximize the benefits for you and the college. These may take the form of bequests, charitable trusts and annuities, pooled income funds, retained life estates, retirement accounts or life insurance policies. Become a Corporate Partner We encourage our alumni and friends to also connect their companies to CS @ ILLINOIS to establish recruiting relationships and to explore sponsored research opportunities.

Illinois is committed to offering an excellent education, delivered by world-class faculty, in the most technologically advanced classrooms and labs, and providing an environment that is both interactive and collaborative, and that establishes relationship networks which benefit CS Illini for a lifetime. State support for higher education continues to decline. As a result, the philanthropic support of our alumni and friends has become increasingly crucial. Not only does your financial support enable us to provide more scholarships, fellowships, and outreach activities, but alumni giving also functions as a measure of the department's strength and impacts our standings in the national rankings. Where We Need Your Help: Funding Priorities We want our alumni and friends not only to feel good about the gifts they give but also to experience the impact these gifts have in the lives of our students and their families. We want to be as transparent as possible in presenting what funding opportunities are available and how your gifts make a difference. The Computer Science Annual Fund Gifts to the CS Annual Fund are used strategically in two ways: to support ongoing programmatic priorities such as student-alumni networking and recruiting opportunities, and funding for our outreach activities to provide seed money for innovations and unique opportunities that come up unexpectedly. In 2013, CS assumed responsibility for the GEMS (Girls Engaged in Math & Science) Camp for middle-school-aged girls. The program encourages girls to consider STEM careers, gives them confidence in using authentic computer tools for math and science, increases their higher level thinking skills, and inspires them to take advanced level mathematics and science courses in high school and college. This camp was provided at no cost to the participants. The department also hosted several events on campus and in locations such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, and New York City, to build key connections between current students and alumni and between students and potential employers. Gifts through the CS Annual Fund enable us to make sustainable investments in key programmatic areas like these. Please support the CS Annual Fund today. CS Visionary Scholarship Fund CS continues to draw students who represent the best of Illinois and the nation. However, we are losing some of these top students—from all backgrounds and financial situations—due to a lack of scholarships. We need help from our alumni, friends, and corporate partners to help CS @ ILLINOIS ensure that cost alone does not put an Illinois education out of reach. The department is actively building its scholarship endowment to increase both the number of scholarships and the amount of financial support that can be offered. We need to be able to provide larger scholarships to more students. Please support the CS Visionary Scholarship Fund today. Naming Opportunities and Special Projects The Department also has several giving opportunities to support faculty through named chairs and professorships, named graduate fellowships and scholarships, and sponsored research and technology projects that foster curricular innovation. For more information ways your support can make a difference, please contact Michelle Wellens, Director of Advancement, by email (mwellens [at] illinois [dot] edu (subject: CS%40ILLINOIS%20Giving%20Inquiry) ) or phone: 217-244-2598.     Department of Computer Science 201 North Goodwin Avenue Urbana, IL 61801-2302 University of Illinois College of Engineering admin [at] cs [dot] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Us) | engrit-web [at] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Webmaster) | Site Map ©2015 The Board of Trustees at the University of Illinois  \n",

Magazine Featured Lectures Videos Corporate Partners About Us Faculty Positions Staff Positions Directory Giving Ways to Give Calendar Twitter Facebook LinkedIn CS Store News Home » News Forsyth Named ACM Fellow By Tom Moone, CS @ ILLINOIS Tue, 12/10/2013 CS Professor David Forsyth has been named a Fellow by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). He is one of 50 so honored for 2013, and he was recognized “for contributions to computer vision,” according to the ACM press release. David Forsyth The ACM Fellows Program celebrates the exceptional contributions of the leading members in the computing field. These individuals have helped to enlighten researchers, developers, practitioners and end-users of information technology throughout the world. These new ACM Fellows join a distinguished list of colleagues to whom ACM and its members look for guidance and leadership in computing and information technology. Forsyth is well-known for his research in geometric methods in object recognition, interpreting color images, the interaction of words and pictures in an image, shading and reconstruction, among other topics. “If it’s got a picture in it, I’m interested in it,” said Forsyth. Some recent work Forsyth has done with his student Kevin Karsh has developed methods for embedding computer generated objects into legacy photographs. Forsyth sees applications for this work in such fields as real estate, in which potential home buyers can place images of furniture into photos of empty rooms, or for furniture companies to allow customers to see what a new piece of furniture would look like in a photo of their home.  Forsyth first became interested in computer vision as an undergraduate at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. There he did an undergraduate final project on particle sized distribution analysis using photographs. This was an important project for local gold mining companies, and set Forsyth off on his career in computer vision. “I got involved in that, and I found it interesting,” said Forsyth. He then went to the UK to complete his graduate work. From there, he went on to positions at the University of Iowa and the University of California, Berkeley. Forsyth has been at the University of Illinois since 2004. Forsyth finds the mystery of vision to be compelling. “One of the biggest mysteries about how people work is how they see, which is still extremely poorly understood,” he said. “I think what I like the most about this work is we understand it so poorly and it’s so fundamental a mystery.” Forsyth is co-author of Computer Vision: A Modern Approach (Prentice Hall), now in its second edition. In 1992 he received a both a Research Initiative Award and a Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. He received the IEEE Technical Achievement Award in 2006 and was named an IEEE Fellow in 2009. The 2013 class of ACM Fellows will be formally recognized in June at the association’s annual awards banquet held in San Francisco.   Media Contacts Media inquiries may be directed to: Tom Moone Associate Director of Communications moone [at] illinois [dot] edu (217) 244-9893 Related Faculty   Department of Computer Science 201 North Goodwin Avenue Urbana, IL 61801-2302 University of Illinois College of Engineering admin [at] cs [dot] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Us) | engrit-web [at] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Webmaster) | Site Map ©2015 The Board of Trustees at the University of Illinois    \n",

To solve these monumental problems, researchers in our area invent, implement, and study new forms of interaction, automation, and visualization techniques. Our research targets problems in social computing, design and creativity, decision making, intelligent systems, and cognitive modeling. For example, we have been studying the transparency of algorithms such as those governing social media feeds, the use of robotics in domestic environments to support aging in place, and the application of crowdsourcing for creative work. Our research synthesizes knowledge from machine learning, psychology, design, and the learning sciences. In graphics and visualization, our research includes modeling and animation of natural phenomena, computational topology, graphics hardware utilization, image based rendering, implicit surfaces, procedural texturing, and surface parameterization. Our area has received funding from the NSF, NASA, IARPA, the US Navy, and the National Robotics Initiative. We work closely with technology companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Google, and Facebook through research funding, student fellowships, and internships. Our alumni have been placed in top academic and industry positions, built exciting startups, and received nationally competitive awards. CS Faculty and Their Research Interests Brian P.

Magazine Featured Lectures Videos Corporate Partners About Us Faculty Positions Staff Positions Directory Giving Ways to Give Calendar Twitter Facebook LinkedIn CS Store News Home » News Four Illinois Women Named Rising Stars Jonathan Damery, Electrical and Computer Engineering Wed, 12/18/2013 Four Illinois students were among the 40 elite graduate and postdoctoral women invited to the Rising Stars of EECS workshop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month. The participants were made up of students at the top of their respective subfields of electrical engineering and computer science, all nominated by faculty members, and the event brought them together to discuss research and the steps into and throughout an academic career. Four women from Illinois attended the Rising Stars in EECS workshop (from left): Hyojin Sung, Yemaya Bordain, Katherine Kim, and Yafang Tan. Photo courtesy of Patricia A. Sampson/MIT EECS. The caliber of the participants was manifest the first day during research presentations, which were exclusively given by students. Topics ranged from microfluidics to lossy data compression, from magnetic resonance imaging to explanatory text analysis. “I was absolutely blown away by some of the presentations there,” said graduate student Yemaya Bordain, one of three ECE students selected for the workshop. “I thought, are you already a faculty member? How’d you sneak in here?” In part, the presentations provided a networking opportunity for the students, many of whom are bound for faculty careers. “It helped me broaden my sense of how my research can contribute to the general field and the benefits of collaborating with people in very different fields,” said Katherine Kim, an ECE graduate student, who presented her research on hot-spot fault detection for solar panel systems, developed with Professor Philip Krein. “If I am ever colleagues with any of these people, I will be ecstatic.” Some collaborations and exchanges even began there, at the workshop. Bordain’s research pertains to innovative probing techniques for atomic-force microscopy, conducted under the direction of Assistant Professor Gang Logan Liu. There was another participant who had encountered a roadblock using the same kind of microscopy. “She had a problem that she did not know how to solve. So I was able to offer her advice on a solution…[Those interactions] made it even more rewarding.” There were also opportunities to interact with junior faculty members and discuss the challenges of establishing a research laboratory, while also maintaining a healthy balance with other responsibilities. “You need to know which is more important than others, and also, you need to learn how to offer help smartly and effectively,” ECE graduate student Yafang Tan reflected on the conversation. “That was a sentence that had been mentioned many, many times…not to be overwhelmed by too many duties, but meanwhile, to smartly manage your load.” Tan researches with Professor Brian Cunningham and presented on nanoscale fabrication for biosensors. The junior faculty members also exemplified alternative career paths, including one who had previously worked in industry. “People say, when you go to industry, it’s very hard to come back to academia because you cannot really publish,” said CS graduate student Hyojin Sung, who is researching parallel computer architecture with CS Professor Sarita Adve. But the faculty member stressed that academic potential was not simply a matter of publication. “What really matters is that your paper has an impact on the community, not how many papers or where you are publishing from,” Sung said. The students participated in workshop courses that addressed the arc of a faculty career, from formulating a mission statement and giving job talks, to the prerequisites for faculty promotions and tenure. “Many faculty preparation workshops emphasize how to do your application, how to get into the job. But not what to do once you get in,” Kim said. “Tenure is about five or seven years down the line, and it helps to know what to expect.” Each of the students pointed out that, while the workshop comprised only female graduate students and postdocs, many of the issues facing young faculty members are universal, regardless of gender. “I don’t think it’s really more specific to females because everyone [has these] concerns,” Tan said. As these 40 women begin their professional careers, perhaps as faculty members at leading institutions, there is no doubt that the “rising star” metaphor will hold true. “I am most honored to have met these other women, and to now…interact with them and watch where they go in their careers,” Bordain said. “I think that might have been the best part of it for me.”   Media Contacts Media inquiries may be directed to: Tom Moone Associate Director of Communications moone [at] illinois [dot] edu (217) 244-9893 Related Faculty   Department of Computer Science 201 North Goodwin Avenue Urbana, IL 61801-2302 University of Illinois College of Engineering admin [at] cs [dot] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Us) | engrit-web [at] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Webmaster) | Site Map ©2015 The Board of Trustees at the University of Illinois    \n",

The award is one of the highest honors received by a student from the College Of Engineering. Every member society in good standing with Engineering Council receives 2 nominations, and Deans and Department Heads also each receive 2 nominations. The nominees selected by these various groups must complete an application packet and get two letters of recommendation. Unused society applications are put into an application pool where societies wanting more than 2 nominations can request more on a first-come first-serve basis. The Knights Selection Committee, which is comprised of former Knights and Honorary Knights, reviews the nominations and selects applicants for interviews, which will take place after students return from Winter Break in January. Based on these interviews, 10-15 people will be selected as Knights of St. Patrick and will be honored at the annual Knights of St. Patrick Ball in March, the Saturday evening of Engineering Open House. An engraved plaque of each Knights class is then permanently hung in the main hallway of Engineering Hall.

Magazine Featured Lectures Videos Corporate Partners About Us Faculty Positions Staff Positions Directory Giving Ways to Give Calendar Twitter Facebook LinkedIn CS Store News Home » News Wang Wins 2015 SIGKDD Dissertation Award Laura Schmitt, CS @ ILLINOIS Mon, 12/07/2015 While data mining technologies are widely used to discover patterns in structured data, such as in databases, there’s a treasure trove of information hidden in unstructured data, such as event logs, product reviews, emails, and social media messages. Researchers have tried to uncover semantically rich structures from these sources of unstructured text with mixed results—that is until Chi Wang (PhD '14) cracked the code. Chi Wang Wang, who worked in CS Professor Jiawei Han’s group, developed methods for mining latent entity structures from massive unstructured and interconnected data, and he applied them to a variety of domains such as academic service, event log and news article explorer, and product review analytics. In August, Wang received the 2015 SIGKDD Dissertation Award—a highly competitive honor in the data mining, machine learning, and data sciences areas—for his breakthrough research that produces quality topics, phrases, and relations with little or no supervision. “This award motivates me to do even better work and make my techniques and methodologies more useful so people recognize the power of data mining,” he said. “It makes me feel that all the hard work at Illinois was worth it and it helped push my career.” Wang’s approach was to model the unstructured data as text-rich heterogeneous information networks capable of handling text only (long articles or informal Tweets, for example), network-only (interconnected data), or text plus links. His work laid down a comprehensive mining framework of hierarchical topics surrounding entities, the roles these entities play, and the relations among entities. According to Wang, his method enables you to analyze what topics a particular person (President Obama, for example) is involved in. “I can analyze news articles that mention Obama and provide a hierarchical view of all the different things like politics, national issues, international issues, or healthcare, for example, that he is involved in,” explained Wang. “Within each of these topics, I can further find significant subtopics and topical phrases so we can analyze in different granularity.” A second functionality of Wang’s method is an ability to analyze the roles of entities in user-desired context and determine the role in a given topical community. Further, given this community and an entity type, his method can determine which entities play the most important roles in the community. “Looking at research publications in CS, we can then learn who the experts are for machine learning, theory, systems, and so on,” said Wang. “Again, my method can perform this analysis with a hierarchical view of different areas.”     According to Wang, his method could also determine the relationship among entities. “For example, by only using research publication data, we can infer what the relationships are between researchers—who is whose advisor, who co-authored what, what areas they published in, when and how long they collaborated,” he explained. “In summary, my mining approach can have entity structures from unstructured data and linked data, and it can transfer that information into rich, useful knowledge,” said Wang, who published a book, Mining Latent Entity Structures, with his advisor Han. “I appreciate Jiawei and all his support. He should get credit for the thesis award.” Professor Han is proud of his student. “My students are very creative, and [Wang] has done really great research overall, publishing about 30 papers when he was here,” said Han. “He also earned a prestigious Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship—the first and only Illinois CS student to get this.” Today, Wang is a researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington, where he is developing algorithms to discover knowledge from unstructured data. These algorithms will be incorporated into products that enable enterprise users to manage data in an easy, interactive way.   Media Contacts Media inquiries may be directed to: Tom Moone Associate Director of Communications moone [at] illinois [dot] edu (217) 244-9893 Related Faculty   Department of Computer Science 201 North Goodwin Avenue Urbana, IL 61801-2302 University of Illinois College of Engineering admin [at] cs [dot] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Us) | engrit-web [at] illinois [dot] edu (Contact Webmaster) | Site Map ©2015 The Board of Trustees at the University of Illinois    \n",
