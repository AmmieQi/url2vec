deceased provost fred terman and associate provost albert bowker conceived of a scientific escalation of computing at stanford from the computer center function to an academic teaching and research function george together with mathematics professor jack herriot deceased founded the division of computer science within the mathematics department in george also served as director of the computer center according to an article in cacm by donald knuth by george s division of computer science contained two faculty members besides himself john herriot and john mccarthy plus two young visiting assistant professors for whom regular appointments were being arranged gene golub deceased and niklaus wirth and an instructor harold van zoeren see knuth on forsythe cacm pdf louis fein was one of the first people to suggest that what we now call computer science ought to be regarded as a discipline in its own right in lou wrote a report commissioned by albert bowker recommending that stanford set up a school devoted to this discipline in lou published an article in the american scientist based on that report entitled the computer related sciences synnoetics at a university in the year prof bill miller now emeritus joined stanford as professor of computer science in december of bill also served as professor and head of the computation group at the stanford linear accelerator center motivated by a comment by george forsythe in gene golub developed a stable and robust algorithm for computing the singular value decomposition svd the algorithm is used in a variety of applications including search engines signal processing and data analysis in john mccarthy started the stanford artificial intelligence project saip the department of computer science is created in january within

requirements guidelines for reasonable progress by spring quarter of the second year a student should complete all six breadth area requirements breadth area requirements in each of areas and file for candidacy by spring quarter of the third year a student should pass a qualifying examination in the area of his or her intended dissertation within one year of passing the qualifying examination a student should submit a signed reading committee form and thesis proposal the teaching requirement may be satisfied at any time as a matter of policy a student should satisfy half of the teaching requirement in the first two years students are encouraged to complete the teaching requirement early in their stay to eliminate conflicts with later dissertation work the research requirement is routinely satisfied by participation in research throughout the student s career candidacy university policy requires that all doctoral students declare candidacy by the end of the sixth quarter in residence excluding summers once you have a permanent advisor and have completed the breadth requirements and the three units of coursework with four instructors faculty that are academic council members you are eligibile to file for candidacy the application for candidacy for doctoral degree forms are available in the program officer s office and at http studentaffairs stanford edu sites default files registrar files a on the form the student must list units of courses either completed or planned not including athletics and performing art classes the form is reviewed and signed first by the student s permanent advisor the advisor s signature indicates the academic adequacy of the proposed program of study the form is then reviewed by the program officer to make sure that it accurately reflects the university and departmental requirements the candidacy form serves as a contract between the department and the student the department acknowledges that the student is a bona fide candidate for the ph d and agrees that the program submitted by the student is sufficient to warrant granting the ph d upon completion the department may not change requirements unilaterally the student may petition the department for modification of his or her program candidacy expires five years from the date of submission of the candidacy form rounded to the end of the quarter in special cases the department may extend a student s candidacy but is under no obligation to do so the monthly stipend increases slightly after candidacy is filed this goes in effect the quarter following submission and approval of the candidacy form petition for ms degree after satisfying the breadth requirement section and the depth requirement qualifying examination and a minimum of units with a gpa of the student is eligible to petition for a master s degree to do so you need to fill out the graduate program authorization petition which is available via axess from the academics panel in your student center select petitions and forms from the drop down menu to submit the grad auth electronically note that the form needs to be completed before deadline to apply to graduate so do not wait until the last minute to complete it there is a application fee to add a master s program to your phd do not forget to apply to graduate for your master s program as well as your phd program in axess when it s time to graduate student financial support the ph d program is a full time program most computer science ph d students are supported by a research or teaching assistantship in computer science or the school of engineering soe or by a fellowship or by an approved assistantship through a collaborating research organization the soe s ph d program is full time and requires full tuition most or all of which is normally covered by such support since ph d students have raships or caships full time equals nine units students with partial or no support may not register part time but must make up any tuition shortfall themselves except as noted hertz nsf npsc fellows may register for nine units also university graduation tgr requirements a student may go tgr after all the ph d requirements have been completed and just their orals and submission of the dissertation remain see cs ph d program milestone checklist for reference students are strongly encouraged to apply for tgr status as soon as they are eligible as the tgr fee is of regular tuition the school of engineering and the university expects students making reasonable progress to be tgr for only one year to advance to tgr status you need to fill out this form unit based requirements students who started their ph d program in september are under the new university graduation tgr requirements in this system the degree requirements are based upon a certain number of completed course units these requirements are course research credit units are required to graduate with the ph d once you have completed the units of course research credit and all program requirements up to your orals and dissertation then you are eligible to apply for tgr status up to units completed at stanford or accepted as transfer credit toward a masters degree may be used toward the units of residency requirement for the doctoral degree application for transfer of credit may be requested after at least one quarter of enrollment those students registered prior to september have a one time option to choose between the tuition based option or the new unit based one if you choose to change to the new requirements you may not go back to the old requirements additional information on enrollment students who are on most fellowships register for at least or units certain outside fellowships require units a quarter so

privileged access i e root or root equivalents for machines managed by csd cf are bestowed to those who need it via the sudocommand sudo is short for superuser do to use it simply prefix the command you want to run as root with sudo for example sudo sbin reboot sudo will ask you to authenticate yourself by typing in your password sudo remembers your password for five minutes after the last sudo command you ran so that you don t have to continually enter your password why we use sudo instead of giving out the root password root is all powerful in unix and unix like systems system administration privileges are all or nothing a user either has root access or not and root access implies complete control of a machine if the machine in question is used by more than one person or root has access to other systems or user files it is more acceptable to give some users partial root privileges the root user can hide all of their actions sudo logs every command run via sudo having a record of what s being done with sudo helps us diagnose problems with individual systems processes and general confiugration issues as well as helping us identify needed improvements the root password gives you access to any command on a system via its config file sudo can give a user root access for particular set of commands this also avoids the all or nothing effect alllowing us to give individual users more control over their machines and to help themselves out of common problems who can get sudo privileges anyone who wants sudo privileges must first read and accept the terms set down by this policy systems people those who have traditionally performed systems administration duties and are responsible for maintaining particular software applications or systems can have sudo

in the computer science department are controlled exclusively by csd cf don t grant sudo access to any user being granted privileged access to a machine does not entitle you to grant the same access to others anyone who needs such access must request it from the system administrators granting privileged access to others will result in loss of privileged access and possible termination of your account choose an extrordinary password for your personal account this is especially important because your password can be used to exercise certain root privileges for similar reasons we expect anyone who accepts these privileges to take extrodinary care in protecting their password never send your password in the clear over the network change your password immediately should you do this never email your password never share your password with anybody don t run network daemons i e no ircd no ftpd if you think you need to run a network service please talk with a system administrator don t use sudo to run a shell e g sudo bash or to just become root via su we know it s a small additional burden to have to prefix each command with sudo but we the systems adminstrators would like to keep a handle on what people are doing to their systems so that chaos does not take over the department it is much easier to diagnose a problem if we know what has been done to a machine to create or attempt to address a problem similarly it is much easier for us to understand how you cleverly solved some problem if we have a record of the actions you performed we use sudo too log trails are an important part of enabling multiple people to manage the complexities of a large system don t use sudo to su to another user it is a violation of department and university policy to use the account of another user doing so will result in the loss of your privileged access and possible termination of your account if you make changes to your system write down what you did not for us for yourself the configuration of linux systems in cs is constantly evolving we will have to reinstall the os on your system from time to time although we will try to keep such reinstalls to a minimum our official policy is that all machines should be able to be rebuilt using our automated kickstart process at any point in time csd cf should be aware of any specific customizations made on a machine to ensure

overview the stanford ai lab cluster is a combination of groups of machines the gorgon dag deep visionlab nlp jude jag jagupard john ladon cvgl and atlas altogether these systems currently provide processor cores and tb of memory the cluster is accessed through a batch queue system that coordinates all jobs running on the cluster the nodes should not be accessed directly as the scheduler will allocate cpus exclusively to each job once you have access to use the cluster you can submit monitor and cancel jobs from the headnode scail this machine should not be used for any compute intensive work however you can get a shell on a compute node simply by starting an interactive job you can use the cluster by starting batch jobs or interactive jobs interactive jobs give you access to a shell on one of the nodes from which you can execute commands by hand whereas batch jobs run from a given shell script in the background and automatically terminate when finished for more information see the links at left if you encounter any problems using the cluster contact action ai stanford edu for assistance usage policy to gain access to the cluster email i your cs login id ii preferred email iii name of professor you re working with to action ai stanford edu if we have any trouble with your job we will try to get in touch with you but we reserve the right to kill your jobs at any time if you have questions about the cluster email action ai stanford edu job submissions use of the cluster is coordinated by a batch queue scheduler which assigns compute nodes to jobs in an order that depends on the time submitted the number of nodes requested and the level of recent usage you can submit two kinds of jobs to the cluster interactive and batch interactive jobs give you access to a shell on one of the nodes from which you can execute commands by hand whereas batch jobs run from a given shell script in the background and automatically terminate when finished generally speaking interactive jobs are used for building and testing while batch jobs are used thereafter batch jobs batch jobs are the most common way to interact with the cluster and are useful when you do not need to interact with the shell to perform the desired task two clear advantages are that your job will be managed automatically after submission and that placing your setup commands in a shell script lets you efficiently dispatch multiple similar jobs to start a batch job on a queue group you work with ssh into scail and type qsub q myqueue my script sh the command will immediately return with a job id which you can use to monitor or delete the job your script will run in a shell with your afs permissions though the working directory may be different you can obtain the directory in which you ran qsub from pbs o workdir if you want to request that multiple nodes be allocated to your job use the following syntax qsub q myqueue l nodes my script sh specifying the desired number of nodes a file listing the nodes allocated to the job is located at the path pbs nodefile if you request multiple nodes your script will run on only one of them and you can ssh into the other nodes to start processes on your other nodes if you need to use multiple cpus or cores on the same node specify how may processors per node for example the following will allocate cores on a single node qsub q myqueue l nodes ppn my script sh if you are running the same script on multiple data units a convenient way to queue a job for each data unit is to specify the path in an environment variable that is exported to your job your shell script can access the variable and act accordingly to submit a job with environment variables use the v option with a comma delimited list of variable names setenv data path data qsub v data path other var my script sh alternatively you can specify the value of a variable inline with the command using qsub v data path data my script sh for further documentation on submitting jobs type man qsub from robo or ai or see the online torque documentation interactive jobs interactive jobs are useful for compiling and testing code intended to run on the cluster performing one time tasks and executing software that requires runtime feedback to start an interactive job ssh into scail and type qsub i q myqueue the command will block until a node is available at which point you will be dropped into a shell on a compute node your kerberos afs credentials will be transferred to the new session so you can access files as usual for the maximum renewable life of your kerberos tickets days when you are finished with the session type exit at the shell or delete the job if you need x forwarding enabled to display x windows programs running on the cluster like matlab add the x flag qsub i x q myqueue if you want to request that multiple nodes be allocated to you use the following syntax qsub i q myqueue l nodes specifying the desired number of nodes you will be dropped into a shell on one of these nodes and the list of nodes allocated to your job can be viewed by typing cat pbs nodefile each line in this file corresponds to one cpu so a host may appear twice if your job has been assigned to both cores of a given node if you re running multi threaded programs that use multiple cpus including multi

can download the academic requirements checklist for the ph d degree cs seminar the cs seminar is offered to incoming first year students in autumn quarter the seminar gives cs faculty the opportunity to speak for minutes about their research the idea is to allow the new cs ph d students the chance to learn about the professor s areas of research before permanently aligning first year cs phd students are required to attend of the seminars to record your attendance to the seminars please go to http cs stanford edu webdb cs and log in using your cs id and password first year research rotation program ph d students rotate through multiple research groups in their first year you do a small research project or help someone on one each quarter the goals are for you to start research immediately to learn some research skills and what each research group is like and for them to learn about you research rotations are used in many other departments such as the various biosciences and physics departments at stanford most students find them an invaluable opportunity to form strong relationships with multiple faculty and students in different research groups to learn skills that will help them in their future research and to get a better understanding of which research group they d like to belong to for their ph d research the goal of the rotation program is to find a permanent advisor by the middle of spring quarter of the first year you should make sure that by the end of the year there s at least one faculty member who is impressed with you and with whom you d like to work for information on how the process works refer to https cs stanford edu content first year research rotation program courses a student should plan and successfully complete a coherent program of study covering the basic areas of computer science and related disciplines the student s advisor has primary responsibility for the adequacy of the program the university has two main requirements related to courses first each student must complete course units not including athletics and performing art classes for graduation cs ph d students take units units is optimal a quarter credit for graduate work done elsewhere up to a maximum of course units may be applied to graduation requirements second students must take courses from at least different faculty members there are no courses specifically required by the computer science department except for the unit cs seminar and cs advanced reading research or equivalent the cs seminar is only offered autumn quarter and is required of all first year ph d students students are required to attend of the total number of sessions in order to get credit for the class note all phd students are required to enroll in at least unit of cs

textbooks for my course there is a small library of cs textbooks located in claire stager s office gates which are available for borrowing by tas texts are to be returned at the end of the quarter make sure to borrow the textbook for the class if you don t have it if it is not in the library the department will probably buy a copy for you should i attend classes it is up to the instructor to decide whether you should attend the classes or not if you attend classes you will be better in sync with the class you will be able to develop your own perspective on the material last but not least the time after class is perfect to meet the students and let them know that you exist they might even be lured into coming to your office hours when should i set my office hours if the class is offered to scpd students one ca should have an office hour sometime after pm so that scpd students can come by after work whether we like it or not students tend to do their homework at the last minute if you set an office hour the day before the homework is due around pm chances are that you will have a very busy time another opinion setting office hours right before due date is convenient for those who procrastinate however it also encourages procrastination there are a couple good reasons for having office hours a little in advance of due dates it doesn t reward procrastination why shouldn t part of education be about discipline and time management it recognizes the fact that assignments aren t always flawless if people need to start looking at the homework well in advance of the due date in order to see what questions they might have for office hours this provides time for the cas to correct or disambiguate the assignment and reduces everyone s stress level every try doing damage control on a flawed assignment at the last moment should i prepare homeworks a teaching assistant should not prepare homeworks except in exceptional cases a homework has to be very well thought out to be in synchronization with the class and it is also extremely hard and lengthy to design good homeworks bad homeworks make students bored with the material and don t make them learn anything if the instructor asks you whether you would like to design the homeworks think very carefully about it and whether you are up to the job in all cases you should not feel obliged to accept as this is an integral part of the normal instructor work it is better not to take this responsibility but to give occasional ideas for good homework questions should i prepare solutions yes if the instructor doesn t have them already it is a good idea to prepare solutions in the light of the errors you saw the most often made while grading at the end of a solution you may list typical mistakes and the reason why these are mistakes so that students learn by the mistakes made by others you will at the same time reduce the number of requests for regradings how to use the copy machine you

instructs each node to print hello world along with its rank and the total number of nodes you can perform any mpi operation between the calls to mpi init and mpi finalize if you encounter an error in between these commands call mpi abort mpi comm world to terminate the process when an mpi job runs n copies of the binary are started on the nodes allocated to your job and each process is assigned a

231	stanford robotics artificial intelligence lab stanford university home projects publications teaching people contact the red sea robotic exploratorium enabling intuitive underwater telemanipulation the red sea robotic exploratorium is one of the major collaborative projects done in the lab involving parties from academia and industry the main aim of the project is to bring together roboticists and marine scientists to develop a novel framework for underwater telemanipulation at the red sea lying between africa and asia the coastal zone of the red sea is an ecologically unique marine ecosystem that houses one of the most extensive diverse and colorful coral reefs in the world the coral reef with its many endemic species of marine invertebrates and fish provides a vital research platform for studying how humans impact marine ecosystems exploring and monitoring these oceanic resources however has remained expensive and challenging because it requires human divers who can only explore these environments during short periods of time and within limited depths while underwater vehicles have proven to be very useful for safely exploring oceans at greater depths they lack human dexterity which is necessary for performing fine manipulation tasks like collecting reef samples furthermore existing underwater robots are large and cumbersome with mechanical characteristics that make them extremely difficult to operate in closely confined fragile spaces or turbulent fluid environments as a part of the kaust global collaborative research program stanford university is part of a team of universities working to build a major science and technology university along a marshy peninsula on saudi arabia s western coast meka robotics currently with google joined the collaboration and provides the hardware for the development of dexterous underwater robot arms to help marine biologists safely explore the red sea s fragile and previously inaccessible underwater environment our team designs a semi autonomous underwater robotic explorer the new vehicle will visually explore and image the sea collect samples perform manipulation tasks using flexible fingers and conduct various physical measurements in multiple marine ecosystems the robot will combine two force controlled lightweight arms that will be remotely operated using an intuitive two handed haptic interface providing force feedback guidance to the operator while the posture of the vehicle body is controlled autonomously this allows us to use the underwater rover for bimanual haptic tele manipulation as an interface between the human operator and the controller two force dimension omega haptic devices as shown above were integrated given the complexity of optimizing the final vehicle a small underwater vehicle serves as a platform to test many of the operations the final vehicle is expected to perform project overview control system architecture hardware design overview arm design designing a compact and light weight arm for underwater purposes is non trivial considering the additional requirements of sealing and pressure compensation several experiments were conducted with a custom made pressure pressure chamber to explore various ways of sealing and to investigate their impact on motor performance joint friction and torque sensing performance the insights gained were then assimilated into the design of a dof bicep module of the robot arm with the dof prototype completed and tested we proceeded to analyze and determine the overall configuration of the arms with respect to the robot we ran simulations and and characterized both static and dynamic requirements that is needed so as to proper macro mini coordination between the arms and vehicle currently we have completed the full design of the arms and are in the process of fabrication we are also running stress tests on the electronic components and writing control softwares for the arms hand design the hand design is done in collaboration with professor mark cutkosky s group at bdml hands are one of the most critical components when it comes to manipulating delicate live specimens like deep sea sponges collect coral samples using a chisel and hammer deploy and position long term sensing equipment or structures retrieve samples below overhangs and in crevices and operate tools designed for human divers therefore it is essential to design and come up with software tools to analyze various grasp configurations and establish a optimal design one of the main challenges of the hand is the compact packaging of all the electronics and motors into a watertight compartment the use of d printing enabled quick design iterations and tests currently we are in the process of building the final design concurrently we are also looking into novel ways of integrating tactile perception and displacement feedback with high level manipulation primitives on the haptics teleoperation interface full system design the design of the entire arm vehicle system is non trivial since it involves the integration of all electromechanical components with our proposed control architecture we adopted a top down approach relying on our custom designed simulation tools and previous research on whole body control framework to place components and determine the required sensor suite for the robot this design methodology banks of the concept of design for control where we start from all the required task specifications of the robot and move upstream to the specification of the arms actuators vehicle s thrusters and body structure currently we are in the process of ordering and testing individual components we will proceed with the final hardware software integration

decomposed into sequences of point to point motions i e movements in space stopping at a given target modeling point to point motions thus provides basic components so called motion primitives for robot control these motions primitives can be seen as a basis from which multiple desired robot tasks can be formed as an example consider the standard pick and place task which can be decomposed as follows first reach to the item then after grasping move to the target location and finally return home after release programming by demonstrations pbd can be used to learn such motion primitives from a few demonstrations of the motions performed by a trained agent human or robot video an overview video of the seds framework and its validation in some challenging experiments approach my research mainly focus on learning robot discrete motions based on non linear time independent dynamical systems ds but why did we choose time independent ds use of time independent ds is advantageous in that it ensures the convergence of all trajectories to the goal from any point in the space it is inherently robust to external perturbations it enables the robot to instantly re act in the face of perturbations all these three properties are crucial when modeling robot motions the first properties guarantees task accomplishment from any point in space the second characteristic compensates for uncertainties in the model e g estimation error in the vision system inaccuracies in a robot s controller unexpected changes in the environment etc and the last one enables a robot to safely and robustly perform super agile task e g tennis swing challenge the main challenge in modeling robot motions with ds is stability stability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems is still an open question and theoretical solutions exist only for particular cases stable estimator of dynamical systems seds stable estimator of dynamical systems seds is powerful method to tackle the big challenge in using ds seds learns the parameters of the ds to ensure that all motions follow closely the demonstrations while ultimately reaching in and stopping at the target more precisely seds is a constrained optimization algorithm that formulates any arbitrary motion as a mixture of gaussian functions the objective function of seds could be mean square error or likelihood the constraints in seds guarantees the global asymptotic stability of a non linear time independent ds figure an example of of learning an arbitrary nonlinear function from demonstrations using seds comparison to dynamic movement primitives dmp though both seds and dmp model robot motions with ds they are different in the way they encode a motion here i briefly pinpoint the main differences for detailed comparison please refer to the main paper pros seds models robot motions with time independent ds hence the resulting model is inherently robust to both temporal and spatial perturbations with any amplitude in contrast dmp is explicitly time dependent through the canonical phase variable in order to have an acceptable results in the face or perturbations dmp depends on a higher level controller to re index in time the canonical system seds is able to model robot motions from any number of demonstrations hence it is able to model the basin of attraction to the target thus it can embed different ways of performing a task into one single model in contrast dmp can only learn motions from one demonstration and cannot encode the basin of attractions since seds can learn from multiple demonstrations it can generalize the motion well in areas not covered with demonstrations even in case where the generalization is not satisfactory for point very far from demonstrations the user can provide the model with more demonstrations to improve generalization i e active learning in contrast since dmp models a motion only from a single demonstration its generalization is limited to areas close to the demonstration seds can model multi dimensional robot motions in contrast dmp is a uni dimensional approach for multi dimensional motions dmp learns each dimension separately hence it cannot model coupling across dimensions cons dmp is a one shot learning algorithm hence it can learn very fast in contrast seds is an iterative learning algorithm that computes the optimal value of a model by solving a constrained optimization problem however the execution time of both seds and dmp are in the same order which makes both method appropriate for realtime implementation back to top
