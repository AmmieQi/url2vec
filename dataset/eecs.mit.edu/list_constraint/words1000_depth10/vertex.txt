researcher and their projects often lead to published research or a prototype engaging in research gives our undergraduates the confidence to push boundaries and solve problems that no one has ever solved before and that s the very definition of research says ian waitz dean of the school of engineering the skills that students gain from superurop and other research based programs continue to impact their lives well after research is finished watch a montage of student research that was presented at the superurop poster session video courtesy of superurop tackling the hard problems the students enrolled in superurop are not shying away from hard hitting problems bradley walcher is working on a football helmet design to reduce the risk of concussion walcher a junior studying aeronautics and astronautics notes that concussions are a growing issue for football players an estimated percent of football players get a concussion every year the prototype walcher and his colleagues are developing uses an inverted cushioning structure and d printing to produce a snug fit i took superurop because i want to go to grad school walcher says and this has given me the experience of doing higher level research which is hard to do as an undergraduate christian argenti a junior studying mechanical engineering is tackling another health problem investigating a

been working in the lab for bio inspired photonic engineering in the department of mechanical engineering for two years and says superurop gave him an opportunity to be immersed in a research setting i love superurop because it gave me a bigger project to work on it really helped me be independent as well as challenging me with projects like the poster session and writing papers in addition to completing the research project students round out their experience by enrolling in a yearlong course uar preparation for undergraduate research where assignments include conducting a literature review writing a journal or conference style research paper and presenting a research poster flora tan a senior studying computer science is applying machine learning to financial data an idea that is just taking hold in the finance sector tan s project uses deep learning techniques to identify and perhaps predict trends in currency exchange rates such as bitcoin i m interested in how technology can disrupt industries like finance and i d like to start a company or technology team in the future tan says superurop has given me a chance to spend time getting a deep understanding of the technologies being used today an interdisciplinary community of scholars expanding superurop to include students from departments across the school of engineering has already shown great promise creating community and exposing undergraduates to new fields we hope to create an interdisciplinary community of scholars says anantha chandrakasan the vannevar bush professor of electrical

beginning of the end for encryption schemes share march jennifer chu mit news office new quantum computer based on five atoms factors numbers in a scalable way researchers have designed and built a quantum computer from five atoms in an ion trap the computer uses laser pulses to carry out shor s algorithm on each atom to correctly factor the number image jose luis olivares mit what are the prime factors or multipliers for the number most grade school students know the answer and by memory a larger number such as may take some pen and paper an even larger number say with digits can and has taken scientists two years to factor using hundreds of classical computers operating in parallel because factoring large numbers is so devilishly hard this factoring problem is the basis for many encryption schemes for protecting credit cards state secrets and other confidential data it s thought that a single quantum computer may easily crack this problem by using hundreds of atoms essentially in parallel to quickly factor huge numbers in peter shor the morss professor of applied mathematics at mit came up with a quantum algorithm that calculates the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than a classical computer however the algorithm s success depends on a computer with a large number of quantum bits while others have attempted to implement shor s algorithm in various quantum systems none have been able to do so with more than a few quantum bits in a scalable way now in a paper published today in the journal science researchers from mit and the university of innsbruck in austria report that they have designed and built a quantum computer from five atoms in an ion trap the computer uses laser pulses to carry out shor s algorithm on each atom to correctly factor the number the system is designed in such a way that more atoms and lasers can be added to build a bigger and faster quantum computer able to factor much larger numbers the results they say represent the first scalable implementation of shor s algorithm we show that shor s algorithm the most complex quantum algorithm known to date is realizable in a way where yes all you have to do is go in the lab apply more technology and you should be able to make a bigger quantum computer says isaac chuang professor of physics and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit it might still cost an enormous amount of money to build you won t be building a quantum computer and putting it on your desktop anytime soon but now it s much more an engineering effort and not a basic physics question seeing through the quantum forest in classical computing numbers are represented by either s or s and calculations are carried out according to an algorithm s instructions which manipulate these s and s to transform an input to an output in contrast quantum computing relies on atomic scale units or qubits that can be simultaneously and a state known as a superposition in this state a single qubit can essentially carry out two separate streams of calculations in parallel making computations far more efficient than a classical computer in chuang a pioneer in the field of quantum computing designed a quantum computer based on one molecule that could be held in superposition and manipulated with nuclear magnetic resonance to factor the number the results which were published in nature represented the first experimental realization of shor s algorithm but the system wasn t scalable it became more difficult to control the system as more atoms were added once you had too many atoms it was like a big forest it was very hard to control one atom from the next one chuang says the difficulty is to implement the algorithm in a system that s sufficiently isolated that it can stay quantum mechanical for long enough that you can actually have a chance to do the whole algorithm straightforwardly scalable chuang and his colleagues have now come up with a new scalable quantum system for factoring numbers efficiently while it typically takes about qubits to factor the number they found a way to shave the system down to five qubits each represented by a single atom each atom can be held in a superposition of two different energy states simultaneously the researchers use laser pulses to perform logic gates or components of shor s algorithm on four of the five atoms the results are then stored forwarded extracted and recycled via the fifth atom thereby carrying out shor s algorithm in parallel with fewer qubits than is typically required the team was able to keep the quantum system stable by holding the atoms in an ion trap where they removed an electron from each atom thereby charging it they then held each atom in place with an electric field that way we know exactly where that atom is in space chuang explains then we do that with another atom a few microns away a distance about th the width of a human hair by having a number of these atoms together they can still interact with each other because they re charged that interaction lets us perform logic gates which allow us to realize the primitives of the shor factoring algorithm the gates we perform can work on any of these kinds of atoms no matter how large we make the system chuang s team first worked out the quantum design in principle his colleagues at the university of innsbruck then built an experimental apparatus based on his methodology they directed the quantum system to factor the number the smallest number that can meaningfully demonstrate shor s algorithm without any prior knowledge of the answers the system returned

of the humansshare march peter dizikes mit news office new book by noam chomsky and robert berwick explores how people acquired unique language skills why only us language and evolution mit press by robert c berwick top left and noam chomsky bottom left for many years researchers tried to teach other kinds of animals some human language chimps dolphins gorillas it didn t seem to matter which animals they tried few experiments were regarded as success stories small children however learn whichever language they are taught and abundant evidence points toward the universality of human language platoons of linguists have detailed strong syntactical similarities among the world s tongues and biologists have begun to identify some of the genes involved in the development of speech and possibly language human language is a generative system that determines an infinite set of possible semantic objects says noam chomsky institute professor and professor of linguistics emeritus at mit people don t realize how uniform the human population is adds robert c berwick a computer scientist at mit we re all very alike as humans and this language capacity is incredibly uniform if you take a baby from southern africa and put it in beijing they ll speak chinese now berwick and chomsky have collaborated on a new book on the topic why only us published on march by the mit press which explores the grand riddles of human language what makes it unique as well as where when why and how humans acquired a distinctive language capacity of nonpareil sophistication out of blombos the questions of when and where human language emerged are probably the simplest to grapple with like some other scholars berwick and chomsky think the emergence of symbolic behavior is a guidepost indicating when human language developed the blombos cave artifacts in south africa comprising engravings and beads that are years old are a possible landmark modern humans arose about years ago so the development of our language capacity most likely falls in between those two points in time still chomsky notes how thin the empirical record is on this count precisely what evolved berwick and chomsky contend is what chomsky calls merge the human cognitive capacity to take any two things that we now recognize as sentence elements and combine them into a new more complex hierarchically structured phrase in its simplest terms the merge operation is just set formation the authors write but if it sounds simple this operation is precisely what allows human language to be infinite there is absolutely no limit on the number of sentences we can form there are some other things that mark human language as distinct so far as we know for instance our statements do not have to make reference to the external world but the unbounded nature of language appears crucial at all times if so how did such a powerful capability emerge in people berwick and chomsky suggest it resulted from not a giant evolutionary leap but a modest evolutionary step that turned out to be very useful what we re arguing is that there was probably a very small change which had large effects chomsky says in the book as well the authors suggest our language capacity was the result of a minor mutation in genomic terms that had far reaching changes in our capacities evolution has often assembled lots of other parts that enable a whole host of other behaviors that you didn t have before berwick observes it the language capacity is standard in that kind of picture it s fully compatible with what a darwinian might have thought he adds we re getting more and more of an understanding of the genomic basis for some of these traits but it s extremely challenging to work out the real leap intentional conceptual thoughts the hardest question to answer it seems is why humans should have a uniquely unbounded language or to put it another way what purpose did language play that made it a useful trait in evolutionary terms berwick and chomsky following decades of work and theorizing by chomsky do not believe that language evolved primarily as a form of communication rather it is an offshoot of the development of our cognitive capacities an inner mental tool as they write at the interface of intentional thought and the ability to think conceptually in this sense merge would be just like any other internal trait that boosted selective advantage they write something that would be helpful in planning making inferences and other basic capacities that said berwick and chomsky readily acknowledge they do not possess a full hypothesis explaining how people developed the capacity for having those abstract conceptual thoughts in the first place there is no explanation of where those come from berwick says the nature of elementary human concepts such as table or chair is unknown and what s striking about them is that they re radically different than anything in the animal world chomsky says it s very different from other animals why only us has received advance praise from other scholars martin nowak a professor of mathematics and biology at harvard university calls it captivating and a must for everyone interested in evolution and humans and berwick and chomsky note that they hope to inspire further research potentially integrating neuroscience to a growing extent in addition to proposing answers to these scientific mysteries or as they write a vast array of language phenomena remain unexplained and even barely examined but the picture sketched here seems to us the most plausible one we have and one that offers many opportunities for fruitful research and inquiry read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts

solar cells as light as a soap bubbleshare february david l chandler mit news office ultrathin flexible photovoltaic cells from mit research could find many new uses the mit team has achieved the thinnest and lightest complete solar cells ever made they say to demonstrate just how thin and lightweight the cells are the researchers draped a working cell on top of a soap bubble without popping the bubble photo joel jean and anna osherov imagine solar cells so thin flexible and lightweight that they could be placed on almost any material or surface including your hat shirt or smartphone or even on a sheet of paper or a helium balloon researchers at mit have now demonstrated just such a technology the thinnest lightest solar cells ever produced though it may take years to develop into a commercial product the laboratory proof of concept shows a new approach to making solar cells that could help power the next generation of portable electronic devices the new process is described in a paper by mit professor vladimir bulovi research scientist annie wang and doctoral student joel jean in the journal organic electronics bulovi mit s associate dean for innovation and the fariborz maseeh professor of emerging technology says the key to the new approach is to make the solar cell the substrate that supports it and a protective overcoating to shield it from the environment all in one process the substrate is made in place and never needs to be handled cleaned or removed from the vacuum during fabrication thus minimizing exposure to dust or other contaminants that could degrade the cell s performance the innovative step is the realization that you can grow the substrate at the same time as you grow the device bulovi says in this initial proof of concept experiment the team used a common flexible polymer called parylene as both the substrate and the overcoating and an organic material called dbp as the primary light absorbing layer parylene is a commercially available plastic coating used widely to protect implanted biomedical devices and printed circuit boards from environmental damage the entire process takes place in a vacuum chamber at room temperature and without the use of any solvents unlike conventional solar cell manufacturing which requires high temperatures and harsh chemicals in this case both the substrate and the solar cell are grown using established vapor deposition techniques one process many materials the team emphasizes that these particular choices of materials were just examples and that it is the in line substrate manufacturing process that is the key innovation different materials could be used for the substrate and encapsulation layers and different types of thin film solar cell materials including quantum dots or perovskites could be substituted for the organic layers used in initial tests but already the team has achieved the thinnest and lightest complete solar cells ever made they say to demonstrate just how thin and lightweight the cells are the researchers draped a working cell on top of a soap bubble without popping the bubble the researchers acknowledge that this cell may be too thin to be practical if you breathe too hard you might blow it away says jean but parylene films of thicknesses of up to microns can be deposited easily using commercial equipment without losing the other benefits of in line substrate formation a flexible parylene film similar to kitchen cling wrap but only one tenth as thick is first deposited on a sturdier carrier material in this case glass figuring out how to cleanly separate the thin material from the glass was a key challenge explains wang who has spent many years working with parylene the researchers lift the entire parylene solar cell parylene stack off the carrier after the fabrication process is complete using a frame made of flexible film the final ultra thin flexible solar cells including substrate and overcoating are just one fiftieth of the thickness of a human hair and one thousandth of the thickness of equivalent cells on glass substrates about two micrometers thick yet they convert sunlight into electricity just as efficiently as their glass based counterparts no miracles needed we put our carrier in a vacuum system then we deposit everything else on top of it and then peel the whole thing off explains wang bulovi says that like most new inventions it all sounds very simple once it s been done but actually developing the techniques to make the process work required years of effort while they used a glass carrier for their solar cells jean says it could be something else you could use almost any material since the processing takes place under such benign conditions the substrate and solar cell could be deposited directly on fabric or paper for example while the solar cell in this demonstration device is not especially efficient because of its low weight its power to weight ratio is among the highest ever achieved that s important for applications where weight is important such as on spacecraft or on high altitude helium balloons used for research whereas a typical silicon based solar module whose weight is dominated by a glass cover may produce about watts of power per kilogram of weight the new cells have already demonstrated an output of watts per gram about times higher it could be so light that you don t even know it s there on your shirt or on your notebook bulovi says these cells could simply be an add on to existing structures still this is early laboratory scale work and developing it into a manufacturable product will take time the team says yet while commercial success in the short term may be uncertain this work could open up new applications for solar power in the long term we have a proof of concept that works bulovi

automatic contingency planningshare february larry hardesty mit news office algorithm lets planning systems generate backup plans efficiently the problem with planning contingencies is that there are so many things that can go wrong if you generated plans for all possible contingencies you d go nuts brian williams says image mit news planning algorithms are widely used in logistics and control they can help schedule flights and bus routes guide autonomous robots and determine control policies for the power grid among other things in recent years planning algorithms have begun to factor in uncertainty variations in travel time erratic communication between autonomous robots imperfect sensor data and the like that causes the scale of the planning problem to grow exponentially but researchers have found clever ways to solve it efficiently now researchers at mit and the australian national university anu have made the problem even more complex by developing a planning algorithm that also generates contingency plans should the initial plan prove too risky it also identifies the conditions say sensor readings or delays incurred that should trigger a switch to a particular contingency plan despite the extra labor imposed by generating contingency plans the algorithm still provides mathematical guarantees that its plans risk of failure falls below some threshold which the user sets the problem with planning contingencies is that there are so many things that can go wrong if you generated plans for all possible contingencies you d go nuts says brian williams a professor of aeronautics and astronautics whose group developed the new system so then the question ends up being how many contingencies do you generate pedro santana a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics is first author on a paper describing the system which he presented at the annual meeting of the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence last weekend he s joined by williams and sylvie thi baux a professor of computer science at the australian national university and a researcher with australia s national information communications technology australia nicta research program which has a partnership with mit probabilistic pruning as williams explains the range of possible decisions that a planner faces can be represented as a data structure called a graph a graph consists of nodes which are usually represented as circles and edges which are represented as line segments connecting the nodes network diagrams and flow charts are familiar examples of a graph in a planning system each node of the graph represents a decision point such as should i take the bus or the subway a path through the graph can be evaluated according to the rewards it offers you reach your destination safely and the penalties it imposes you ll be five minutes late the optimal plan is the one that maximizes reward factoring in probabilities makes that type of reward calculation much more complex the average bus trip might be minutes but there s some chance that it will be the average subway trip might be minutes but it s almost never more than in that context for even a relatively simple planning task canvassing contingency plans can be prohibitively time consuming to make the problem tractable the mit and anu researchers borrowed a technique from some earlier work from williams group before the planner begins constructing the graph it asks the user to set risk thresholds a researcher trying to develop a data gathering plan for a multimillion dollar underwater robot for example might be satisfied with a percent probability that the robot will take all the sensor readings it s supposed to but they might want a percent probability that the robot won t collide with a rock face at high speed the researchers algorithm treats these thresholds as a risk budget that it spends as it explores paths through the graph if the planner determines that a given branch of the graph will exceed the budget it lops it off staying optimistic that determination has to be rapid however so the researchers use some simple rules of thumb or in computer parlance heuristics to evaluate branches every path through a given branch for instance might include a different car route between two points each with its own probability distribution of possible travel times but if traversing a straight line between the points at the maximum allowed speed will still incur intolerable delays there s no point in evaluating probabilities for every route the branch can be eliminated as long as the heuristics are optimistic possibly underestimating risk but never overestimating it the planner can lop off branches without compromising the quality of the final plans sometimes those heuristics are application specific like the one that evaluates routes geometrically but sometimes they re not for instance one of the reasons that probability distributions add so much complexity to planning calculations is that they re nonlinear their graphs take on shapes that are more complicated than simple lines in a paper being presented at the international conference on automated planning and scheduling in june santana again first author williams and colleagues at mit the university of s o paulo in brazil and caltech describe a way to produce linear approximations of probability distributions that are much easier to work with mathematically those approximations are optimistic they never overestimate risk but a computer can evaluate them thousands of times faster than it can a nonlinear distribution such heuristics offer hope that the researchers planning system could update plans on the fly in light of new information as well as generating contingency plans in advance the authors have tackled a very important problem that is highly relevant to nasa missions where we are increasingly reliant on autonomous behaviors programmed into our spacecraft says michel ingham technical group supervisor for the system architectures and behaviors group at nasa s jet propulsion laboratory their work is especially relevant

enabling human robot rescue teamsshare february larry hardesty mit news office system could help prevent robots from overwhelming human teammates with information communication system could make it easier to design systems that enable humans and robots to work together in emergency response teams image jose luis olivares mit autonomous robots performing a joint task send each other continual updates i ve passed through a door and am turning degrees right after advancing feet i ve encountered a wall i m turning degrees right after advancing feet i ve encountered a wall and so on computers of course have no trouble filing this information away until they need it but such a barrage of data would drive a human being crazy at the annual meeting of the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence last weekend researchers at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail presented a new way of modeling robot collaboration that reduces the need for communication by percent they believe that their model could make it easier to design systems that enable humans and robots to work together in for example emergency response teams we haven t implemented it yet in human robot teams says julie shah an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics and one of the paper s two authors but it s very exciting because you can imagine you ve just reduced the number of communications by percent and presumably those other communications weren t really necessary toward the person achieving their part of the task in that team the work could have also have implications for multirobot collaborations that don t involve humans communication consumes some power which is always a consideration in battery powered devices but in some circumstances the cost of processing new information could be a much more severe resource drain in a multiagent system the computer science term for any collaboration among autonomous agents electronic or otherwise each agent must maintain a model of the current state of the world as well as a model of what each of the other agents takes to be the state of the world these days agents are also expected to factor in the probabilities that their models are accurate on the basis of those probabilities they have to decide whether or not to modify their behaviors communication costs in some scenarios a robot s decision to broadcast a new item of information could force its fellows to update their models and churn through all those probabilities again if the information is inessential broadcasting it could introduce serious delays to no purpose and the mit researchers work suggests that percent of communications in multiagent systems may be inessential the state of the art method for modeling multiagent systems is called a decentralized partially observable markov decision process or dec pomdp a dec pomdp factors in several types of uncertainty not only does it consider whether an agent s view of the world is correct and whether its estimate of its fellows worldviews is correct it also considers whether any action it takes will be successful the robot may plan for instance to move forward feet but find that crosswinds blow it off course dec pomdps generally assume some prior knowledge about the environment in which the agents will be operating because shah and vaibhav unhelkar a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics and first author on the new paper were designing a system with emergency response applications in mind they couldn t make that assumption emergency response teams will usually be entering unfamiliar environments and the very nature of the emergency could render the best prior information obsolete adding the requirement of mapping the environment on the fly however makes the problem of computing a multiagent plan prohibitively time consuming so shah and unhelkar s system ignores uncertainty about actions effectiveness and assumes that whatever an agent attempts to do it will do balancing act when an agent acquires a new item of information that for instance a given passage through a building is blocked it has three choices it can ignore the information it can use it but not broadcast it or it can use it and broadcast it each of these choices has benefits but imposes costs in shah and unhelkar s model communication is a cost but if an agent incorporates new information into its own model of the world and doesn t broadcast it it also incurs a cost as its worldview becomes more difficult for its fellows to estimate correctly for every new item of information an agent acquires shah and unhelkar s system performs that cost benefit analysis based on the agent s model of the world its expectations of its fellows actions and the likelihood of accomplishing the joint goal more efficiently the researchers tested their system on more than computer simulations of rescue tasks in unfamiliar environments a version of their system that permitted extensive communication completed the tasks at a rate between and percent higher than the version that reduced communication by percent in the experiments however all the agents were electronic what i d be willing to bet although we have to wait until we do the human subject experiments is that the human robot team will fail miserably if the system is just telling the person all sorts of spurious information all the time shah says for human robot teams i think that this algorithm is going to make the difference between a team that can function effectively versus a team that just plain can t in a separate research project members of shah s group have asked teams of human subjects to execute similar virtual rescue missions that computer systems did in the experiments reported in the new paper using machine learning algorithms the researchers have mined the results for statistics on human communication patterns which

to greek myth designed the labyrinth that trapped the minotaur is one of the oldest symbols of human ingenuity credited with the invention of the saw the ax glue and the ship s sail among other things constantinos daskalakis a recently tenured associate professor of computer science and engineering at mit comes from a cretan family and while it s fanciful to suggest that the ingenuity of his work in theoretical computer science owes anything to the example of daedalus the problems he explores are undoubtedly labyrinthine much of daskalakis work concentrates on the application of computer science techniques to game theory a discipline that attempts to get a quantitative handle on human strategic reasoning game theory models human interactions as a series of moves in a clearly defined game each move represents an instance of a particular strategy and may elicit a different response from the other players leading to different rewards even a simple game with only a handful of players can take vastly more twists and turns than the largest physical labyrinth daskalakis parents are both from crete but they met in athens where they had come for college his father to study mathematics and his mother to study ancient greek literature and philosophy until he came to the u s for graduate school daskalakis lived in the greater athens area like one third of the country s population when you ask the question where are you from in greece it has a different meaning than when you ask it in the states daskalakis says in the states it means where you grew up in greece it means where your family originated from both of daskalakis parents were teachers and as a child he showed an interest in and an aptitude for both of their disciplines in junior high however he competed in the math olympiad and finished second in the country though literature remains important to him his mit web page features the complete text of a poem by the great greek modernist poet constantine cavafy from then on he was marked as a student with exceptional mathematical promise game theory in greece every high school senior opts to take one of three sets of standardized tests which determines his or her university placement daskalakis score on the technical exam was the fifth highest in the country earning him a spot at the prestigious national technical university of athens he enrolled in the five year electrical engineering and computer science curriculum the first half of which is spent canvassing a huge range of topics from the physics of individual electrical components to the most esoteric questions in theoretical computer science sampling this big spectrum satiated my desire in the applied domain daskalakis says i understood i could write a complicated program and then decided ok now i know how to write a program let s do math daskalakis applied to and was accepted by graduate programs at several u s universities and during his fifth year he came to the united states to visit them at the university of california at berkeley he was captivated by the computer scientist christos papadimitriou a recipient of both of the association for computing machinery s major awards for theoretical computer science papadimitriou s larger than life personality was celebrated in the bestselling comic book logicomix he s a very inspiring person daskalakis says and a founding father of the interaction between computer science and economics after returning to greece daskalakis chose to focus on that interaction for his undergraduate thesis game theory has been a staple of economics research since when john nash who taught at mit from to and is the subject of the movie a beautiful mind published the seminal paper that would ultimately win him the nobel prize in economics every game has what s called a nash equilibrium which describes a balance of strategies that no player has an incentive to change unilaterally daskalakis thesis investigated nash equilibria for games that can be represented as highly regular networks of interactions the paper was accepted to the th annual european symposium on algorithms i still find it a very elegant piece of work daskalakis says intractability in after graduating daskalakis moved to berkeley to continue his study of algorithmic game theory with papadimitriou four years later his doctoral dissertation won the association for computing machinery s thesis award in it daskalakis proves that computing the nash equilibrium for a three person game is computationally intractable that means that for any but the simplest of games all the computers in the world couldn t calculate its nash equilibrium in the lifetime of the universe consequently daskalakis argues it s unlikely that the real world markets modeled by game theorists have converged on nash equilibria either i have been blessed throughout my career with the most brilliant graduate students and collaborators but costis daskalakis is different from all papadimitriou says i had been working on what ended up being his thesis problem the complexity of nash equilibria for more than two decades in the fall of conversations with costis who remarkably had just started his first year of graduate studies at berkeley inspired me to give it another good push and this ultimately led to an important result during his last year at berkeley daskalakis got a job offer from mit but he deferred it for a year to do a postdoc at microsoft research new england it was really a year for me to step back and think about what i want to do next before coming to mit and being very busy daskalakis says when computer scientists run up against an intractable problem their first recourse

energy friendly chip can perform powerful artificial intelligence tasks share february larry hardesty mit news office advance could enable mobile devices to implement neural networks modeled on the human brain mit researchers have designed a new chip to implement neural networks it is times as efficient as a mobile gpu so it could enable mobile devices to run powerful artificial intelligence algorithms locally rather than uploading data to the internet for processing image mit news in recent years some of the most exciting advances in artificial intelligence have come courtesy of convolutional neural networks large virtual networks of simple information processing units which are loosely modeled on the anatomy of the human brain neural networks are typically implemented using graphics processing units gpus special purpose graphics chips found in all computing devices with screens a mobile gpu of the type found in a cell phone might have almost cores or processing units making it well suited to simulating a network of distributed processors at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco this week mit researchers presented a new chip designed specifically to implement neural networks it is times as efficient as a mobile gpu so it could enable mobile devices to run powerful artificial intelligence algorithms locally rather than uploading data to the internet for processing neural nets were widely studied in the early days of artificial intelligence research but by the s they d fallen out of favor in the past decade however they ve enjoyed a revival under the name deep learning deep learning is useful for many applications such as object recognition speech face detection says vivienne sze an assistant professor of electrical engineering at mit whose group developed the new chip right now the networks are pretty complex and are mostly run on high power gpus you can imagine that if you can bring that functionality to your cell phone or embedded devices you could still operate even if you don t have a wi fi connection you might also want to process locally for privacy reasons processing it on your phone also avoids any transmission latency so that you can react much faster for certain applications the new chip which the researchers dubbed eyeriss could also help usher in the internet of things the idea that vehicles appliances civil engineering structures manufacturing equipment and even livestock would have sensors that report information directly to networked servers aiding with maintenance and task coordination with powerful artificial intelligence algorithms on board networked devices could make important decisions locally entrusting only their conclusions rather than raw personal data to the internet and of course onboard neural networks would be useful to battery powered autonomous robots division of labor a neural network is typically organized into layers and each layer contains a large number of processing nodes data come in and are divided up among the nodes in the bottom layer each node manipulates the data it receives and passes the results on to nodes in the next layer which manipulate the data they receive and pass on the results and so on the output of the final layer yields the solution to some computational problem in a convolutional neural net many nodes in each layer process the same data in different ways the networks can thus swell to enormous proportions although they outperform more conventional algorithms on many visual processing tasks they require much greater computational resources the particular manipulations performed by each node in a neural net are the result of a training process in which the network tries to find correlations between raw data and labels applied to it by human annotators with a chip like the one developed by the mit researchers a trained network could simply be exported to a mobile device this application imposes design constraints on the researchers on one hand the way to lower the chip s power consumption and increase its efficiency is to make each processing unit as simple as possible on the other hand the chip has to be flexible enough to implement different types of networks tailored to different tasks sze and her colleagues yu hsin chen a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the conference paper joel emer a professor of the practice in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science and a senior distinguished research scientist at the chip manufacturer nvidia and with sze one of the project s two principal investigators and tushar krishna who was a postdoc with the singapore mit alliance for research and technology when the work was done and is now an assistant professor of computer and electrical engineering at georgia tech settled on a chip with cores roughly as many as a mobile gpu has act locally the key to eyeriss s efficiency is to minimize the frequency with which cores need to exchange data with distant memory banks an operation that consumes a good deal of time and energy whereas many of the cores in a gpu share a single large memory bank each of the eyeriss cores has its own memory moreover the chip has a circuit that compresses data before sending it to individual cores each core is also able to communicate directly with its immediate neighbors so that if they need to share data they don t have to route it through main memory this is essential in a convolutional neural network in which so many nodes are processing the same data the final key to the chip s efficiency is special purpose circuitry that allocates tasks across cores in its local memory a core needs to store not only the data manipulated by the nodes it s simulating but data describing the nodes themselves the allocation circuit can be reconfigured for different types of networks automatically distributing both types

toward hack proof rfid chipsshare february larry hardesty mit news office new technology could secure credit cards key cards and pallets of goods in warehouses researchers have designed an rfid chip that prevents so called side channel attacks which analyze patterns of memory access or fluctuations in power usage when a device is performing a cryptographic operation in order to extract its cryptographic key pictured here is a standard rfid chip mit researchers have developed a new type of radio frequency identification rfid chip that is extremely difficult to hack if such chips were widely adopted it could mean that an identity thief couldn t steal your credit card number or key card information by sitting next to you at a caf and high tech burglars couldn t swipe expensive goods from a warehouse and replace them with dummy tags texas instruments has built several prototypes of the new chip to the researchers specifications and in experiments the chips have behaved as expected the researchers presented their research this week at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco according to chiraag juvekar a graduate student in electrical engineering at mit and first author on the new paper the chip is designed to prevent so called side channel attacks side channel attacks analyze patterns of memory access or fluctuations in power usage when a device is performing a cryptographic operation in order to extract its cryptographic key the idea in a side channel attack is that a given execution of the cryptographic algorithm only leaks a slight amount of information juvekar says so you need to execute the cryptographic algorithm with the same secret many many times to get enough leakage to extract a complete secret one way to thwart side channel attacks is to regularly change secret keys in that case the rfid chip would run a random number generator that would spit out a new secret key after each transaction a central server would run the same generator and every time an rfid scanner queried the tag it would relay the results to the server to see if the current key was valid blackout such a system would still however be vulnerable to a power glitch attack in which the rfid chip s power would be repeatedly cut right before it changed its secret key an attacker could then run the same side channel attack thousands of times with the same key power glitch attacks have been used to circumvent limits on the number of incorrect password entries in password protected devices but rfid tags are particularly vulnerable to them since they re charged by tag readers and have no onboard power supplies two design innovations allow the mit researchers chip to thwart power glitch attacks one is an on chip power supply whose connection to the chip circuitry would be virtually impossible to cut and the other is a set of nonvolatile memory cells that can store whatever data the chip is working on when it begins to lose power for both of these features the researchers juvekar anantha chandrakasan who is juvekar s advisor and the vannevar bush professor of electrical engineering and computer science hyung min lee who was a postdoc in chandrakasan s group when the work was done and is now at ibm and joyce kwong who did her master s degree and phd with chandrakasan and is now at texas instruments use a special type of material known as a ferroelectric crystals as a crystal a ferroelectric material consists of molecules arranged into a regular three dimensional lattice in every cell of the lattice positive and negative charges naturally separate producing electrical polarization the application of an electric field however can align the cells polarization in either of two directions which can represent the two possible values of a bit of information when the electric field is removed the cells maintain their polarization texas instruments and other chip manufacturers have been using ferroelectric materials to produce nonvolatile memory or computer memory that retains data when it s powered off complementary capacitors a ferroelectric crystal can also be thought of as a capacitor an electrical component that separates charges and is characterized by the voltage between its negative and positive poles texas instruments manufacturing process can produce ferroelectric cells with either of two voltages volts or volts the researchers new chip uses a bank of volt capacitors as an on chip energy source but it also features volt cells that are discretely integrated into the chip s circuitry when the chip s power source the external scanner is removed the chip taps the volt capacitors and completes as many operations as it can then stores the data it s working on in the volt cells when power returns before doing anything else the chip recharges the volt capacitors so that if it s interrupted again it will have enough power to store data then it resumes its previous computation if that computation was an update of the secret key it will complete the update before responding to a query from the scanner power glitch attacks won t work because the chip has to charge capacitors and complete computations every time it powers on it s somewhat slower than conventional rfid chips but in tests the researchers found that they could get readouts from their chips at a rate of per second which should be more than fast enough for most rfid applications in the age of ubiquitous connectivity security is one of the paramount challenges we face says ahmad bahai chief technology officer at texas instruments because of this texas instruments sponsored the authentication tag research at mit that is being presented at isscc we believe this research is an important step toward the goal of a robust low cost low power authentication protocol for the industrial internet

visually impaired users carry a mechanical braille interface developed at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory which conveys information about the distance to the nearest obstacle in the direction the user is moving mit researchers have developed a low power chip for processing d camera data that could help visually impaired people navigate their environments the chip consumes only one thousandth as much power as a conventional computer processor executing the same algorithms using their chip the researchers also built a prototype of a complete navigation system for the visually impaired about the size of a binoculars case and similarly worn around the neck the system uses an experimental d camera from texas instruments the user carries a mechanical braille interface developed at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail which conveys information about the distance to the nearest obstacle in the direction the user is moving the researchers reported the new chip and the prototype navigation system in a paper presented earlier this week at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco there was some prior work on this type of system but the problem was that the systems were too bulky because they require tons of different processing says dongsuk jeon a postdoc at mit s microsystems research laboratories mtl when the work was done who joined the faculty of seoul national university in south korea this year we wanted to miniaturize this system and realized that it is critical to make a very tiny chip that saves power but still provides enough computational power jeon is the first author on the new paper and he s joined by anantha chandrakasan the vannevar bush professor of electrical engineering and computer science daniela rus the andrew and erna viterbi professor of electrical engineering and computer science priyanka raina a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science nathan ickes a former research scientist at mtl who s now at apple computer and hsueh cheng wang a postdoc at csail when the work was done who will join the national chiao tung university in taiwan as an assistant professor this month in work sponsored by the andrea bocelli foundation which was founded by the blind singer andrea bocelli rus group had developed an algorithm for converting d camera data into useful navigation aids the output of any d camera can be converted into a d representation called a point cloud which depicts the spatial locations of individual points on the surfaces of objects the rus group s algorithm clustered points together to identify flat surfaces in the scene then measured the unobstructed walking distance in multiple directions for the new paper the researchers modified this algorithm with power conservation in mind the standard way to identify planes in point clouds for instance is to pick a point at random then look at its immediate neighbors and determine whether any of them lie in the same plane if one of them does the algorithm looks at its neighbors determining whether any of them lie in the same plane and so on gradually expanding the surface this is computationally efficient but it requires frequent requests to a chip s main memory bank because the algorithm doesn t know in advance which direction it will move through the point cloud it can t reliably preload the data it will need into its small working memory bank fetching data from main memory however is the biggest energy drain in today s chips so the mit researchers modified the standard algorithm their algorithm always begins in the upper left hand corner of the point cloud and scans along the top row comparing each point only to the neighbor on its left then it starts at the leftmost point in the next row down comparing each point only to the neighbor on its left and to the one directly above it and repeats this process until it has examined all the points this enables the chip to load as many rows as will fit into its working memory without having to go back to main memory this and similar tricks drastically reduced the chip s power consumption but the data processing chip isn t the component of the navigation system that consumes the most energy the d camera is so the chip also includes a circuit that quickly and coarsely compares each new frame of data captured by the camera with the one that immediately preceded it if little changes over successive frames that s a good indication that the user is still the chip sends a signal to the camera which can lower its frame rate saving power although the prototype navigation system is less obtrusive than its predecessors it should be possible to miniaturize it even further currently one of its biggest components is a heat dissipation device atop a second chip that converts the camera s output into a point cloud adding the conversion algorithm to the data processing chip should have a negligible effect on its power consumption but would significantly reduce the size of the system s electronics in addition to the andrea bocelli foundation the work was cosponsored by texas instruments and the prototype chips were manufactured through the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company s university shuttle program read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering

people personshare january catherine curro caruso mit news correspondent senior sami alsheikh helps others solves problems and has fun doing both in research contexts i m driven mostly by the technical difficulty of the problem and the opportunity to learn sami alsheikh explains photo ian maclellan sami alsheikh s time at mit has been guided by a few simple principles pursue things you enjoy develop useful skills that can be applied in different ways and help people as much as possible over the past four years whether he has been absorbed in computer science courses building a platform to increase political engagement or playing with campers as a counselor at camp kesem alsheikh has managed to live by all three alsheikh a senior computer science and engineering major grew up in pensacola florida his parents both physicians moved from syria to the united states before he was born seeking better professional opportunities alsheikh s extended family still lives in syria and he and his family visited every summer until alsheikh describes pensacola as a politically conservative region a sharp contrast to the more liberal area around mit he appreciates that his experiences living in parts of the united states with differing political views along with his visits to syria have provided him with diverse perspectives about the world alsheikh first set his eyes on mit while researching top institutions for math and science but for him what makes mit special is the people that was one of the biggest draws for me and has proven to be one of the best things explains alsheikh there s kind of this guarantee that everyone here has worked to become really clever at something it s awesome to be a part of a collaborative community with people like that computer science is the tool when alsheikh came to mit he planned on studying physics but over the course of his freshman year he found himself gravitating toward computer science which he describes as more of a tool than a subject i saw that computer science touched on a lot of different subjects he says it has this theoretical and precise appeal of purer sciences like math and physics while still providing the applicability of engineering he experienced this first hand during an mit course where he designed a computer game called balloon boy that involves a boy with a balloon who must move left and right to avoid falling nails that could pop the balloon that sounds really silly he admits but it actually kick started everything because of how interdisciplinary it was as alsheikh and his classmates designed the game they drew on a number of different fields including physics which they needed to accurately simulate the drag and buoyancy of the balloon alsheikh is currently doing computer science research in mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail with wojciech matusik associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science who leads the computational fabrication group the research focuses on using newly developed radar technologies to understand different environments radar offers advantages over video because it doesn t require light and has the potential to pick up on additional characteristics such as texture or material properties alsheikh s work involves taking readings with small new high frequency radar chips and exploring different analysis methods to derive meaning from the data he stays motivated by focusing on the technical problem at hand in research contexts i m driven mostly by the technical difficulty of the problem and the opportunity to learn he explains alsheikh is also interested in socially impactful applications of his computer science skills as part of start iap a four week startup accelerator for mit students he is working on building a web based platform that will encourage people to become more engaged in u s policy i don t know what legislation is passed and neither do a lot of people explains alsheikh we re trying to build this platform where based on your demographic information and your interests we tell you how current legislation that s being considered affects you helping others and having fun beyond his academic interests alsheikh also enjoys helping people offering the simple explanation that he does it because it makes him feel good over the past three years alsheikh has been involved in camp kesem a one week overnight camp for kids ages to whose parents have been affected by cancer the camp which is celebrating its th anniversary this summer now serves over children each summer free of charge it is a place where the campers are able to open up and find support but also have fun and enjoy themselves despite their tough situations it s really a great deal says alsheikh it sounds like it s supposed to be a therapy camp maybe have a little bit of a sad mood but it s actually nothing like that alsheikh who enjoys that camp allows him to embrace his goofy energetic side reveals that all of the campers and counselors choose camp names new identities that heighten the fun his is cheese the counterpart of mac a k a jonathon zuniga alsheikh s freshman year roommate and fellow counselor while there are opportunities for campers to share their stories and talk about everything they are dealing with for alsheikh the magic of camp is that the kids can be regular kids which often isn t the case at home it s really about the small fun moments more than anything he explains the campers already know their situation at home and they don t always want to explore that further i think they enjoy being with counselors and other campers who are there to have fun and offer support it shows them that they can still have a light hearted time

optoelectronic microprocessors built using existing chip manufacturingshare december larry hardesty mit news high performance prototype means chipmakers could now start building optoelectronic chips researchers have produced a working optoelectronic chip that computes electronically but uses light to move information the chip has optical components and million transistors which while significantly less than the billion odd transistors of a typical microprocessor is enough to demonstrate all the functionality that a commercial optical chip would require image glenn j asakawa using only processes found in existing microchip fabrication facilities researchers at mit the university of california at berkeley and the university of colorado have produced a working optoelectronic microprocessor which computes electronically but uses light to move information optical communication could dramatically reduce chips power consumption which is not only desirable in its own right but essential to maintaining the steady increases in computing power that we ve come to expect demonstrating that optical chips can be built with no alteration to existing semiconductor manufacturing processes should make optical communication more attractive to the computer industry but it also makes an already daunting engineering challenge even more difficult you have to use new physics and new designs to figure out how you take ingredients and process recipes that are used to make transistors and use those to make photodetectors light modulators waveguides optical filters and optical interfaces says mit professor of electrical engineering rajeev ram referring to the optical components necessary to encode data onto different wavelengths of light transmit it across a chip and then decode it how do you build all the optics using only the layers out of a transistor it felt a bit like an episode of macgyver where he has to build an optical network using only old computer parts the project began as a collaboration between ram vladimir stojanovi and krste asanovic who were then on the mit department of electrical engineering and computer science faculty stojanovi and asanovic have since moved to berkeley and they ram and milo a popovic who was a graduate student and postdoc at mit before becoming an assistant professor of electrical engineering at colorado are the senior authors on a paper in nature that describes the new chip they re joined by co authors eight of whom were at mit when the work was done including two of the four first authors graduate students chen sun and jason orcutt who has since joined ibm s t j watson research center powering down the chip has optical components and million transistors which while significantly less than the billion odd transistors of a typical microprocessor is enough to demonstrate all the functionality that a commercial optical chip would require in tests the researchers found that the performance of their transistors was virtually indistinguishable from that of all electronic computing devices built in the same facility computer chips are constantly shipping data back and forth between logic circuits and memory and today s chips cannot keep the logic circuits supplied with enough data to take advantage of their ever increasing speed boosting the bandwidth of the electrical connections between logic and memory would require more power and that would raise the chips operating temperatures to unsustainable levels optical data connections are in principle much more energy efficient and unlike electrical connections their power requirements don t increase dramatically with distance so optical connections could link processors that were meters rather than micrometers apart with little loss in performance the researchers chip was manufactured by globalfoundries a semiconductor manufacturing company that uses a silicon on insulator process meaning that in its products layers of silicon are insulated by layers of glass the researchers build their waveguides the optical components that guide light atop a thin layer of glass on a silicon wafer then they etch away the silicon beneath them the difference in refractive index the degree to which a material bends light between the silicon and the glass helps contain light traveling through the waveguides conflicting needs one of the difficulties in using transistor manufacturing processes to produce optical devices is that transistor components are intended to conduct electricity at least some of the time but conductivity requires free charge carriers which tend to absorb light particles limiting optical transmission computer chips however generally use both negative charge carriers electrons and positive charge carriers holes or the absence of an electron where one would be expected that means that somewhere in there there should be some way to block every kind of carrier implant that they re doing for every layer ram explains we just had to figure out how we do that in an optoelectronic chip at some point light signals have to be converted to electricity but contact with metal also interferes with optical data transmission the researchers found a way to pattern metal onto the inner ring of a donut shaped optical component called a ring resonator the metal doesn t interact with light traveling around the resonator s outer ring but when a voltage is applied to it it can either modify the optical properties of the resonator or register changes in a data carrying light signal allowing it to translate back and forth between optical and electrical signals on the new chip the researchers demonstrated light detectors built from these ring resonators that are so sensitive that they could get the energy cost of transmitting a bit of information down to about a picojoule or one tenth of what all electronic chips require even over very short distances the new paper certainly is an important result says jagdeep shah a researcher at the u s department of defense s institute for defense analyses who as a program director at the defense advanced research project agency initiated the program that sponsored the researchers work it is not at the megascale yet and there are steps

scott aaronson on google s new quantum computing papershare december larry hardesty mit news google experiments suggest that the d wave computer exploits quantum phenomena scott aaronson photo bryce vickmark in a canadian company called d wave announced that it had begun production of what it called the world s first commercial quantum computer which was based on theoretical work done at mit quantum computers promise to solve some problems significantly faster than classical computers and in at least one case exponentially faster in a consortium including google and nasa bought one of d wave s machines over the years critics have argued that it s unclear whether the d wave machine is actually harnessing quantum phenomena to perform its calculations and if it is whether it offers any advantages over classical computers but this week a group of google researchers released a paper claiming that in their experiments a quantum algorithm running on their d wave machine was million times faster than a comparable classical algorithm scott aaronson an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit has been following the d wave story for years mit news asked him to help make sense of the google researchers new paper q the google researchers paper focused on two algorithms simulated annealing and quantum annealing what are they a simulated annealing is one of the premier optimization methods that s used today it was invented in the early s by direct analogy with what happens when people anneal metals which is a year old technology you heat the metal up the atoms are all jiggling around randomly and as you slowly cool it down the atoms are more and more likely to go somewhere that will decrease the total energy in the case of an algorithm you have a whole bunch of bits that start flipping between and willy nilly regardless of what that does to the solution quality and then as you lower the temperature a bit becomes more and more unwilling to flip in a way that would make the solution worse until at the end when the temperature is zero a bit will only go to the value that keeps the solution going straight downhill toward better solutions the main problem with simulated annealing or for that matter with any other local search method is that you can get stuck in local optima if you re trying to reach the lowest point in some energy landscape you can get stuck in a crevice that is locally the best but you don t realize that there s a much lower valley somewhere else if you would only go up and search simulated annealing tries to deal with that already when the temperature is high then you re willing to move up the hill sometimes but if there s a really tall hill even if it s a very very narrow hill just imagine it s a big spike sticking out of the ground it could take you an exponential amount of time until you happen to flip so many bits that you happen to get over that spike in quantum mechanics we know that particles can tunnel through barriers this is the language that the physicists use which is a little bit misleading there s an important paper by farhi goldstone and gutmann all of whom are here at mit and what they showed is that if your barrier really is a tall thin spike then quantum annealing can give you an exponential speedup over classical simulated annealing classical annealing is going to get stuck at the base of that spike for exponential time and quantum annealing is going to tunnel over it and get down to the global minimum in polynomial time q so is the d wave machine using quantum tunneling a in the current model of the d wave chip there are or so qubits quantum bits but they re organized into clusters of eight qubits each the qubits within each cluster are very tightly connected to each other and between clusters there are only weaker connections i think that this is the best evidence we ve had so far for quantum tunneling behavior at least at the level of the eight bit clusters the main way that they got an advantage over simulated annealing in these results was by taking advantage of the fact that quantum tunneling or anything that correlates all the qubits within the cluster can flip all the bits within each cluster at the same time whereas simulated annealing is going to try flipping the bits one by one then see that that s not a good idea then flip them all back and not realize that by flipping all eight of them you could get something better the case has now clearly been made that whatever the d wave device is doing it s something that can tunnel past this eight qubit barrier of course that still doesn t mean that you re doing anything faster than you could do it classically q what does it mean then a in computer science normally we care about asymptotic speedup we care about what is your running time as a function of the size of the problem does it grow linearly does it grow quadratically the constant that s in front does it take n steps does it take n steps we don t care that much about we just care that it s linear in n in the google paper they discuss two classical algorithms that do match the asymptotic performance and one of them beats the real world performance of the d wave machine so besides simulated annealing there are two more classical algorithms that are actors in this story one of them is quantum monte carlo which is actually a classical optimization

recognizing correct codeshare january larry hardesty mit news office automatic bug repair system fixes times as many errors as its predecessors one of the most intriguing aspects of this research is that we ve found that there are indeed universal properties of correct code that you can learn from one set of applications and apply to another set of applications martin rinard says photo mit news mit researchers have developed a machine learning system that can comb through repairs to open source computer programs and learn their general properties in order to produce new repairs for a different set of programs the researchers tested their system on a set of programming errors culled from real open source applications that had been compiled to evaluate automatic bug repair systems where those earlier systems were able to repair one or two of the bugs the mit system repaired between and depending on whether it settled on the first solution it found or was allowed to run longer while an automatic bug repair tool would be useful in its own right professor of electrical engineering and computer science martin rinard whose group developed the new system believes that the work could have broader ramifications one of the most intriguing aspects of this research is that we ve found that there are indeed universal properties of correct code that you can learn from one set of applications and apply to another set of applications rinard says if you can recognize correct code that has enormous implications across all software engineering this is just the first application of what we hope will be a brand new fabulous technique fan long a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science at mit presented a paper describing the new system at the symposium on principles of programming languages last week he and rinard his advisor are co authors users of open source programs catalogue bugs they encounter on project websites and contributors to the projects post code corrections or patches to the same sites so long was able to write a computer script that automatically extracted both the uncorrected code and patches for errors in eight common open source applications stored in the online repository github feature performance as with all machine learning systems the crucial aspect of long and rinard s design was the selection of a feature set that the system would analyze the researchers concentrated on values stored in memory either variables which can be modified during a program s execution or constants which can t they identified prime characteristics of a given value it might be involved in an operation such as addition or multiplication or a comparison such as greater than or equal to it might be local meaning it occurs only within a single block of code or global meaning that it s accessible to the program as a whole it might be the variable that represents the final result of a calculation and so on long and rinard wrote a computer program that evaluated all the possible relationships between these characteristics in successive lines of code more than such relationships constitute their feature set their machine learning algorithm then tried to determine what combination of features most consistently predicted the success of a patch all the features we re trying to look at are relationships between the patch you insert and the code you are trying to patch long says typically there will be good connections in the correct patches corresponding to useful or productive program logic and there will be bad patterns that mean disconnections in program logic or redundant program logic that are less likely to be successful ranking candidates in earlier work long had developed an algorithm that attempts to repair program bugs by systematically modifying program code the modified code is then subjected to a suite of tests designed to elicit the buggy behavior this approach may find a modification that passes the tests but it could take a prohibitively long time moreover the modified code may still contain errors that the tests don t trigger long and rinard s machine learning system works in conjunction with this earlier algorithm ranking proposed modifications according to the probability that they are correct before subjecting them to time consuming tests the researchers tested their system which they call prophet on a set of program errors that had cropped up in eight popular open source programs of those are amenable to the type of modifications that long s algorithm uses the other have more complicated problems that involve logical inconsistencies across larger swaths of code when long and rinard configured their system to settle for the first solution that passed the bug eliciting tests it was able to correctly repair of the errors when they allowed it to run for hours per problem it repaired of course that still leaves the other errors in the test set untouched in ongoing work long is working on a machine learning system that will look at more coarse grained manipulation of program values across larger stretches of code in the hope of producing a bug repair system that can handle more complex errors a revolutionary aspect of prophet is how it leverages past successful patches to learn new ones says eran yahav an associate professor of computer science at the technion in israel it relies on the insight that despite differences between software projects fixes patches applied to projects often have commonalities that can be learned from using machine

the beaver logos to show photoluminescence emissions from a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide inlayed onto graphene the arrow indicates the graphene mos lateral heterostructure which could potentially form the basis for ultrathin computer chips courtesy of the researchers today computer chips are built by stacking layers of different materials and etching patterns into them but in the latest issue of advanced materials mit researchers and their colleagues report the first chip fabrication technique that enables significantly different materials to be deposited in the same layer they also report that using the technique they have built chips with working versions of all the circuit components necessary to produce a general purpose computer the layers of material in the researchers experimental chip are extremely thin between one and three atoms thick consequently this work could abet efforts to manufacture thin flexible transparent computing devices which could be laminated onto other materials the methodology is universal for many kinds of structures says xi ling a postdoc in the research laboratory of electronics and one of the paper s first authors this offers us tremendous potential with numerous candidate materials for ultrathin circuit design the technique also has implications for the development of the ultralow power high speed computing devices known as tunneling transistors and potentially for the integration of optical components into computer chips it s a brand new structure so we should expect some new physics there says yuxuan lin a graduate

however uses two materials with very different lattice sizes molybdenum disulfide and graphene which is a single atom thick layer of carbon moreover the researchers fabrication technique generalizes to any material that like molybdenum disulfide combines elements from group six of the periodic table such as chromium molybdenum and tungsten and elements from group such as sulfur selenium and tellurium many of these compounds are semiconductors the type of material that underlies transistor design and exhibit useful behavior in extremely thin layers graphene which the researchers chose as their second material has many remarkable properties it s the strongest known material but it also has the highest known electron mobility a measure of how rapidly electrons move through it as such it s an excellent candidate for use in thin film electronics or indeed in any nanoscale electronic devices to assemble their laterally integrated circuits the researchers first deposit a layer of graphene on a silicon substrate then they etch it away in the regions where they wish to deposit the molybdenum disulfide next at one end of the substrate they place a solid bar of a material known as ptas they heat the ptas and flow a gas across it and across the substrate the gas carries ptas molecules with it and they stick to the exposed silicon but not to the graphene wherever the ptas molecules stick they catalyze a reaction with another gas that causes a layer of molybdenum disulfide to form in previous work the researchers characterized a range of materials that promote the formation of crystals of other compounds any of which could be plugged into the process future electronics the new fabrication method could open the door to more powerful computing if it can be used to produce tunneling transistor processors fundamentally a transistor is a device that can be modulated to either allow a charge to cross a barrier or prohibit it from crossing in a tunneling transistor the charge crosses the barrier by means of a counterintuitive quantum mechanical effect in which an electron can be thought of as disappearing at one location and reappearing at another these effects are subtle so they re more pronounced at extremely small scales like the one to three atom thicknesses of the layers in the researchers experimental chip and because electron tunneling is immune to the thermal phenomena that limit the efficiency of conventional transistors tunneling transistors can operate at very low power and could achieve much higher speeds this work is very exciting says philip kim a physics professor at harvard university the mit team demonstrated that controlled stitching of two completely different atomically thin d materials is possible the electrical properties of the resulting lateral heterostructures are very impressive read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

local boy makes goodshare january larry hardesty mit news office michael watts took two decades to make the mile trip from suburban hingham to tenure at mit for both his master s and his doctoral theses michael watts pictured developed a photonic circuit that could align the polarizations of light traveling through an optical chip photo bryce vickmark mit has become an increasingly international institution attracting top technical talent from all over the planet but michael watts who recently earned tenure in the department of electrical engineering and computer science is as local as they come watts grew up in hingham massachusetts about miles from cambridge working summers and vacations for his parents flooring and rug company which his grandfather had founded as a teen he once had a job installing flooring at draper laboratory which spun out from the lab of mit aeronautical engineering professor charles stark draper and has offices a few blocks away from the kendall mit subway station at hingham high school watts fell under the spell of a physics teacher named charles dirk a former navy officer dirk was a very excitable character watts says if somebody didn t get it he would get red in the face but watts responded well to dirk s teaching style taking two classes with him and earning perfect scores on both the college board s physics achievement test and the advanced placement physics exam dirk was a teacher who definitely made a difference on many young minds a unique character and gifted teacher watts says for college watts says i wanted to stay local so he headed to tufts university in the boston suburb of medford about a mile from the cambridge border he d planned to study mechanical engineering but tufts had just opened a new center for the study of optoelectronics or the integration of optical and electronic signal processing a family friend who worked at polaroid which had its own optoelectronic research program urged watts to check it out almost immediately watts was hooked optics and particularly optoelectronics would remain the theme of his studies and future research cantabrigian after graduating from tufts in watts got a job at draper lab where he d been laying floors just a few years earlier he wasn t the only member of the draper technical staff without a graduate degree but he was certainly in the minority nonetheless he distinguished himself enough to attract the attention of hermann haus an mit institute professor and optics pioneer who was collaborating with some of the lab s researchers when after three years at draper watts applied to mit to do a phd in haus group haus wrote one of his letters of recommendation haus was working on what at the time was the cutting edge field of silicon photonics many researchers were investigating other more exotic semiconductors for use in optoelectronics but silicon is of course the fundamental component of all modern computing devices and there were reasons to believe that the combination of silicon and silicon dioxide which was already used in commercial manufacturing processes could yield very small optical components haus thinking was that if it should prove possible to build optical components from silicon the component density and material compatibility would make it much easier and more affordable to integrate them with electronics one problem with silicon optical components was that they tended to work only with strongly polarized light light whose waves are all oriented in the same direction for both his master s and his doctoral theses watts developed a photonic circuit that splits the polarization states of incoming light into two perpendicular components then rotates one of them to align it with the other making silicon photonics polarization independent was essential to integrating them with existing optical communication systems decision points one morning when he was a graduate student watts was walking down the street near his boston apartment when he brushed shoulders with a young woman who looked a little like someone he d last seen years earlier the daughter of some friends of his parents who also owned a flooring business in new hampshire he turned and called after her amy when she stutter stepped he called her name again and they stopped to catch up it turned out that she too was in a doctoral program at the new england college of optometry the same spring that watts graduated from mit he and amy were married as graduation approached watts applied for two jobs one at mit s lincoln laboratory and one at sandia national laboratories my research was going well watts says so i decided to push that component first and figured if i decided later i wanted to teach i could do so after i had established myself in my field i think it s asking a lot to have faculty come in and have to build up a world class research portfolio in a limited period of time while also learning how to teach which by itself is a full time job lincoln lab was interested but had no openings in its silicon photonics group sandia had a modern silicon fabrication facility but no silicon photonics group it offered watts the chance to build one so he and amy headed for new mexico at sandia watts managed to secure in funding from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa a meager sum for research that requires as much high tech prototyping as silicon photonics does nonetheless watts team was able to build most of the core components of a silicon photonic platform including a modulator that set a record for low power consumption and a high speed switch which together won an r d award from r d magazine five years after arriving at sandia watts was running a million a year research program

department requirements some faqs what departmental requirements does satisfy students in the program may select as one of their ee or cs foundation subjects all eecs students may select as one of their math elective or free elective subjects i am in could i select as a foundation subject what about prerequisites yes please note that currently there is no eecs header that follows this means that in order to take at least one ee header subject as required by the program you must take at least one of or as a foundation subject i am in could i select and as my foundation subjects this is a more cs centric program if you feel that this set of foundation subjects accurately reflects your future plans for header subjects and auss you should consider switching to in that case you could take as foundations and count as a math elective or free elective as the answer to the previous question explains students must take at least one of or as your foundation subject to be able to satisfy the requirement of at least one ee header what if i am committed to or can i get credit for in this case you can certainly get credit for as a math elective for or or free elective you just can t currently use it to satisfy your foundation requirement i am the degree requirements state that i must select as one of my math electives i also noticed that several subjects require as a prerequisite the website states that i can petition to take instead of what is the purpose of the petition the department views as an adequate prerequisite for subjects that require with one exception introduces students to the concept of precise formal proofs and helps them build skills for constructing proofs while is a mathematically rigorous subject proofs are not explicitly part of its syllabus as part of your petition you will need to make a convincing case that either you already have had sufficient exposure to proofs by telling us where you learned about the concept and how rigorous your training was or that you are committed to and capable of learning the concept on your own before you take more advanced subjects that require as a prerequisite note that the subsequent subjects will make no allowances for students who took instead of and will assume that all students are familiar with proofs if you have questions about this or are unsure if your background in proofs is adequate we will be happy to meet and help you understand if this is the right path for you please don t hesitate to contact us please also note that you must file the petition and get it approved before the add date in fall most of our foundation subjects lead to more advanced subjects in the curriculum is this the case for indeed it is a new header level course introduction to machine learning was introduced in spring and can serve as a cs header subject instead of while does not currently require the two courses form a natural sequence building up to more advanced subjects in inference and machine learning including and the final structure of the subject sequence is being currently discussed in the department and will be likely finalized in the next year i am not in course can i take this subject of course this subject is for anyone at mit who wants an introduction to the fundamentals of inference will have labs like some of the other foundation subjects no the subject will not have traditional labs it will be problem set based however computational aspects of inference are an important aspect of the subject and thus problem sets will consist of a combination of analytical and computational exercises to reinforce the material from class with my schedule i am not sure if i will be able to take this offering of on what schedule will this subject be offered in future years the plan is to offer the subject once per year for the next couple of years while it gets up to speed in the longer term we anticipate the course being offered each term i have not taken the official prerequisite but i notice that students without this subject can take with permission of the instructors what kind of background is expected we will assume that students in the class have had at least a brief introduction to probability and random variables in a prior subject for example provides a roughly two week introduction to such material this will be our starting point in the first week of classes we will hand out a brief diagnostic problem set that will help remind students what we want them to remember from if they took it or otherwise help students assess their background for mit electrical

wireless x ray vision could power virtual reality smart homes and hollywoodshare october adam conner simons csail by seeing silhouettes through a wall csail device could help with motion capture fall prevention and even your heating bill by testing different human subjects and using metrics such as height and body shape to create concrete silhouette fingerprints for each person researchers can use wireless reflections to differentiate between individuals from the other side of wall images fadel adib csail a team of researchers at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail has long believed that wireless signals like wifi can be used to see things that are invisible to the naked eye since csail researchers have been developing technologies that use wireless signals to track human motion the team has shown that it can detect gestures and body movements as subtle as the rise and fall of a person s chest from the other side of a house allowing a mother to monitor a baby s breathing or a firefighter to determine if there are survivors inside a burning building next up seeing a person s silhouette and even distinguishing between individuals in a paper accepted to the siggraph asia conference taking place next month the team presents a new technology called rf capture that picks up wireless reflections off the human body to see the silhouette of a human standing behind a wall by tracking the silhouette the device can trace a person s hand as he writes in the air and even distinguish between different people through a wall with nearly percent accuracy in other words from the opposite side of a building rf capture can determine where you are who you are and even which hand you are moving from heating bills to hollywood researchers say the technology could have major implications for everything from gaming and filmmaking to emergency response and eldercare take for example motion capture in movie production today actors have to wear markers on their bodies and move in a specific room full of cameras says phd student fadel adib who is lead author on the new paper rf capture would enable motion capture without body sensors and could track actors movements even if they are behind furniture or walls the device s motion capturing technology makes it equally valuable for smart homes according to mit professor and paper co author dina katabi we re working to turn this technology into an in home device that can call if it detects that a family member has fallen unconscious says katabi director of the wireless mit center you could also imagine it being used to operate your lights and tvs or to adjust your heating by monitoring where you are in the house future versions could be integrated into gaming interfaces allowing you to interact with a game from different rooms or even trigger distinct actions based on which hand you move the possibilities are vast says adib whose other co authors include mit professor fr do durand phd student chen yu hsu and undergraduate intern hongzi mao we re just at the beginning of thinking about the different ways to use these technologies the device works by transmitting wireless signals that traverse the wall and reflect off a person s body back to the device the emitted radiation is approximately the amount given off by a standard cellphone the device captures these reflections and analyzes them in order to see the person s silhouette the key challenge however is that different individuals and for that matter different body parts all reflect the same signal which raises the question how can we analyze these reflections to distinguish between different limbs much less entire humans the data you get back from these reflections are very minimal says katabi however we can extract meaningful signals through a series of algorithms we developed that minimize the random noise produced by the reflections the technology operates in two stages first it scans d space to capture wireless reflections off objects in the environment including the human body however since only a subset of body parts reflect the signal back at any given point in time the device then monitors how these reflections vary as someone moves in the environment and intelligently stitches the person s reflections across time to reconstruct his silhouette into a single image o differentiate between people the team then repeatedly tested and trained the device on different subjects using metrics such as height and body shape to create concrete silhouette fingerprints for each person the researchers have clearly already recognized the technology s commercial potential team members are in the process of spinning out a product called emerald that aims to detect predict and prevent falls among the elderly in august the team presented emerald to president obama as part of the white house s first annual demo day in the same way that cellphones and wifi routers have become indispensable parts of today s households says katabi wireless technologies like this will help power the homes of the future read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts

faster optimizationshare october larry hardesty mit news new general purpose optimization algorithm promises order of magnitude speedups on some problems cutting plane methods converge on the optimal values of a mathematical function by repeatedly cutting out regions of a much larger set of possibilities gold sphere illustration jose luis olivares mit optimization problems are everywhere in engineering balancing design tradeoffs is an optimization problem as are scheduling and logistical planning the theory and sometimes the implementation of control systems relies heavily on optimization and so does machine learning which has been the basis of most recent advances in artificial intelligence this week at the ieee symposium on foundations of computer science a trio of present and past mit graduate students won a best student paper award for a new cutting plane algorithm a general purpose algorithm for solving optimization problems the algorithm improves on the running time of its most efficient predecessor and the researchers offer some reason to think that they may have reached the theoretical limit but they also present a new method for applying their general algorithm to specific problems which yields huge efficiency gains several orders of magnitude what we are trying to do is revive people s interest in the general problem the algorithm solves says yin tat lee an mit graduate student in mathematics and one of the paper s co authors previously people needed to devise different algorithms for each problem and then they needed to optimize them for a long time now we are saying if for many problems you have one algorithm then in practice we can try to optimize over one algorithm instead of many algorithms and we may have a better chance to get faster algorithms for many problems lee is joined on the paper by aaron sidford who was an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science when the work was done but is now at microsoft research new england and by sam wong who earned bachelor s and master s degrees in math and electrical engineering and computer science at mit before moving to the university of california at berkeley for his phd inner circle optimization problems are generally framed as trying to find the minimum value of a mathematical function called a cost function in car design for example the cost function might impose penalties for weight and drag but reward legroom and visibility in an algorithm for object detection the cost function would reward correct classification of various objects and penalize false positives at a very general level finding the minimum of a cost function can be described as trying to find a small cluster of values amid a much larger set of possibilities suppose that the total range of possible values for a cost function is represented by the interior of a circle in a standard optimization problem the values clustered around the minimum value would then be represented by a much smaller circle inside of the first one but you don t know where it is now pick a point at random inside the bigger circle in standard optimization problems it s generally possible to determine whether that point lies within the smaller circle if it doesn t it s also possible to draw a line that falls between it and the smaller circle drawing that line cuts off a chunk of the circle eliminating a range of possibilities with each new random point you pick you chop off another section of the circle until you converge on the solution if you represent the range of possibilities as a sphere rather than a circle then you use a plane rather than a line to cut some of them off hence the name for the technique the cutting plane method in most real optimization problems you need a higher dimensional object than either a circle or a sphere you need a hypersphere which you cut with a hyperplane but the principle remains the same a matter of time theoretical computer scientists measure algorithms running times not in seconds or hours but in the number of operations required relative to the number of elements being manipulated with cutting plane methods the number of elements is the number of variables in the cost function the weight of the car the cost of its materials drag legroom and so on that s also the dimension of the hypersphere with the best general purpose cutting plane method the time required to select each new point to test was proportional to the number of elements raised to the power sidford lee and wong get that down to but they also describe a new way to adapt cutting plane methods to particular types of optimization problems with names like submodular minimization submodular flow matroid intersection and semidefinite programming and in many of those cases they report dramatic improvements in efficiency from running times that scale with the fifth or sixth power of the number of variables n or n in computer science parlance down to the second or third power n or n this is indeed an astonishing paper says satoru iwata a professor of mathematical informatics at the university of tokyo who has published widely on the problem of submodular minimization for this problem he says the running time bounds derived with the aid of discrete geometry and combinatorial techniques are by far better than what i could

more flexible machine learningshare october larry hardesty mit news office giving machine learning systems partial credit during training improves image classification flickr users tagged a photograph similar to this one architecture tourism and travel a machine learning system that used a novel training strategy developed at mit proposed sky roof and building when it used a conventional training strategy it came up with art sky and beach image mit news machine learning which is the basis for most commercial artificial intelligence systems is intrinsically probabilistic an object recognition algorithm asked to classify a particular image for instance might conclude that it has a percent chance of depicting a dog but a percent chance of depicting a cat at the annual conference on neural information processing systems in december mit researchers will present a new way of doing machine learning that enables semantically related concepts to reinforce each other so for instance an object recognition algorithm would learn to weigh the co occurrence of the classifications dog and chihuahua more heavily than it would the co occurrence of dog and cat in experiments the researchers found that a machine learning algorithm that used their training strategy did a better job of predicting the tags that human users applied to images on the flickr website than it did when it used a conventional training strategy when you have a lot of possible categories the conventional way of dealing with it is that when you want to learn a model for each one of those categories you use only data associated with that category says chiyuan zhang an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and one of the new paper s lead authors it s treating all other categories equally unfavorably because there are actually semantic similarities between those categories we develop a way of making use of that semantic similarity to sort of borrow data from close categories to train the model zhang is joined on the paper by his thesis advisor tomaso poggio the eugene mcdermott professor in the brain sciences and human behavior and by his fellow first author charlie frogner also a graduate student in poggio s group hossein mobahi a postdoc in the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and mauricio araya polo a researcher with shell oil round out the paper s co authors close counts to quantify the notion of semantic similarity the researchers wrote an algorithm that combed through flickr images identifying tags that tended to co occur for instance sunshine water and reflection the semantic similarity of two words was a function of how frequently they co occurred ordinarily a machine learning algorithm being trained to predict flickr tags would try to identify visual features that consistently corresponded to particular tags during training it would be credited with every tag it got right but penalized for failed predictions the mit researchers system essentially gives the algorithm partial credit for incorrect tags that are semantically related to the correct tags say for instance that a waterscape was tagged among other things water boat and sunshine with conventional machine learning a system that tagged that image water boat summer would get no more credit than one that tagged it water boat rhinoceros with the researchers system it would and the credit would be a function of the likelihood that the tags summer and sunshine co occur in the flickr database the problem is that assigning partial credit involves much more complicated calculations than simply scoring predictions as true or false how for instance does a system that gets none of the tags completely right say lake sail and summer compare to one that makes only one enormous error say water boat and rhinoceros to perform this type of complicated evaluation the researchers use a metric called the wasserstein distance which is a way of comparing probability distributions that would have been prohibitively time consuming even two years ago but in marco cuturi of the university of kyoto and arnaud doucet of oxford university proposed a new algorithm for calculating the wasserstein distance more efficiently the mit researchers believe that their paper is the first to use the wasserstein distance as an error metric in supervised machine learning where the system s performance is gauged against human annotations human error in experiments the researchers system outperformed a conventional machine learning system even when the criterion of success was simply predicting the tags that flickr users had applied to a given image but the difference was even more acute when the criterion of success was the prediction of tags that were semantically similar to those applied by flickr users that may sound circular a system that factors in semantic similarity is better at predicting semantic similarity but when a web user is trying to find images online a general thematic correspondence may well be more important than a precise intersection of keywords moreover the tags that users assign to any given flickr image can be a motley assortment automatically generated tags clustered according to semantic similarity could be more useful than those applied by humans one image in the researchers test set for instance depicted a uniformed mountain biker wearing a crash helmet biking down a hilly trail the actual tags were spring race and training but the trees in the image are bare the grass is brown and the tags race and training can t both be right the researchers system came up with road bike and trail the conventional machine learning algorithm produced dog surf and bike finally if some other measure of the notion of semantic similarity proved better able to capture human intuition than co occurrence of flickr tags then the mit researchers system could simply adopt it instead indeed a longstanding and ongoing project in artificial intelligence research is the assembly of ontologies that relate classification

organ on a chipshare january helen knight mit news correspondent in a step toward personalized drug testing researchers coax human stem cells to form complex tissues this image demonstrates tissue patterns that emerge from genetically programmed human pluripotent stem cells and was taken on day nine of the mit study it shows immunostainings of cell nuclei for cebpa red endodermal marker sox green ectodermal marker and dapi blue binds to dna in the nucleus courtesy of the researchers a new technique for programming human stem cells to produce different types of tissue on demand may ultimately allow personalized organs to be grown for transplant patients the technique which also has near term implications for growing organ like tissues on a chip was developed by researchers at mit and is unveiled in a study published today in the journal nature communications growing organs on demand using stem cells derived from patients themselves could eliminate the lengthy wait that people in need of a transplant are often forced to endure before one becomes available it could also reduce the risk of a patient s immune system rejecting the transplant since the tissue would be grown from the patient s own cells according to ron weiss professor of biological engineering at mit who led the research imagine that there is a patient with liver complications weiss says we could take skin cells from that person and then convert them into stem cells and then genetically program them to make the liver tissue and transplant that into the patient a rudimentary organ the researchers developed the new technique while investigating whether they could use stem cells to produce pancreatic beta cells for treating patients with diabetes in order to do this the researchers needed to devise a means to convert stem cells into pancreatic beta cells on demand as a first step in this process they took human induced pluripotent stem ips cells stem cells generated from adult fibroblast or skin cells and converted them into endoderm one of the three primary cell types in a developing organism endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm make up the three so called germ layers that contribute to nearly all of the different cell types in the body they are the first real step of cell differentiation weiss says the researchers developed a method to use a type of small molecule called dox to induce the ips cells to express a protein known as gata this protein can convert ips cells into endoderm rather than immediately attempting to convert these endoderm cells into pancreatic cells though the paper s lead author patrick guye a former postdoc in weiss lab and currently laboratory head with sanofi aventis in frankfurt germany then decided to allow the cells to continue growing to monitor their progress after two weeks the researchers found that the endoderm and some mesoderm also present in the cell culture had matured further to form a liver bud or small rudimentary liver we observed the development of many cells types found in the fetal liver including the development of blood vessel like networks various mesenchymal precursors and the formation of early red and white blood cells within our liver like tissue guye says this is especially exciting as the process looks very similar if not identical to what is happening in the early liver bud in vivo that is in our own development what s more the researchers discovered that only those ips cells that had been exposed to more of the genetic programming and had therefore gone on to produce more gata became liver tissue alongside these were ips cells that did not make much gata which went on to form ectoderm instead and then further matured to become early telencephalon or forebrain by controlling how much gata the cells expressed the researchers were able to determine how much liver bud and how much forebrain tissue was generated weiss says this suggests that the technique could be used to produce not just individual tissue types but different combinations of tissue he says the fact that we are able to produce endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm gives us great hope that we can take each of these germ layers and hopefully grow any kind of tissue we want he says liver on a chip while it is likely to be some time before the technique can be used to generate transplant organs it could be used almost immediately to grow different human tissue on which to test new drugs weiss says using human stem cell derived organ tissue to test new treatments could be far more reliable than testing on animals since different species may react differently to a drug he says the technique could also allow clinicians to carry out patient specific drug testing if you are not sure whether you will have complications from taking a particular drug then before you take it you could try it out on your own liver on a chip weiss says similarly the organ on a chip could be used to monitor the interaction between different drugs that people may be taking as people age some are taking or drugs together and it s impossible for the pharmaceutical companies to test all of these combinations for every individual but we would be able to test that out he says that is something that can be done now in addition to these therapeutic applications the technique could allow researchers to gain a better understanding of the development of different types of tissue such as the liver and neurons the paper reveals some intrinsic mechanisms underlying the interactions of stem cells during liver development and provides a useful model that sheds light on the complex process of embryogenesis says bing song a professor of tissue engineering at cardiff university in the uk who was not involved

mit s fujitsu professor in electrical engineering and computer science according to the world health organization who around million people worldwide die in traffic accidents annually while somewhere between and million more suffer nonfatal injuries the who also estimates that without action traffic accidents could become the seventh leading cause of death worldwide moving from ninth by over the years cmt has collected promising data on the app s effectiveness and on driver safety in general the startup has users in eight countries and is now partnered with a number of major insurance companies and service providers including discovery insure of south africa desjardins insurance of canada hellas direct of greece and towers watson the startup has also developed an optional hardware component called the drivewell tag which attaches to a car s windshield and augments smartphone data the tag also provides real time crash detection and roadside assistance when the tag detects an accident it transmits data to the phone and then to cmt s servers an operator from a call center then contacts with the driver to provide assistance the south african challenge cmt partnered with discovery insure a leading telematics based insurance provider to launch the safe driving competition in south africa in and this was a huge challenge for us and one we relished because south africa has one of the highest accident rates in the world balakrishnan says the who reports that south africa has fatalities per inhabitants annually from traffic accidents one of the highest recorded rates worldwide more than people participated in the south african competition for four months last year and the app became one of the most downloaded iphone apps in the country drivers earned points for safe driving and entered those points into a lottery for weekly rewards and a grand prize at the start of the contest percent of drivers said they were safe drivers but the initial data indicated that only about percent actually were within two weeks cmt and discovery found that unsafe speeding among the riskiest participants dropped by to percent participants also cut down their hard braking cornering and phone usage incidents by half the app helped drivers improve the data shows that drivers with low scores below improved by percent in just two days this shows that safe drivers are made not born balakrishnan says the app s effectiveness balakrishnan says lies in incentives not just insurance discounts but also social games feedback to drivers leaderboards badges and friendly competitions for prizes in this way cmt hopes to pioneer positive behavioral incentives that recognize and reward an individual s safe driving behaviors many of the app s users for instance can already send regular updates on their driving scores to their insurance providers and receive adjusted quotes in real time getting the signal cmt is a spinout of cartel a project initiated in by madden a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and balakrishnan then at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail the researchers aimed to use mobile sensing and data analytics to improve road transportation between and the cartel project fitted many cars and taxis in boston with small onboard computers that exchanged data wirelessly about delays traffic jams potholes and hazardous road conditions this gave drivers updates on traffic conditions and offered real time alternative routes with the rise of smartphones preloaded with gps and sensors for motion vibration and speed the professors saw an opportunity to integrate their cartel algorithms into devices that everyone was already carrying in through the mit industrial liaison program the two professors connected with a large u s insurance company that ran extensive field tests of cmt s smartphone based telematics technologies at the time insurance firms were piloting dongles in on board diagnostic systems for usage based insurance ubi programs we thought we could match what the dongles were measuring solely through phones balakrishnan says but there were initial worries about generating inaccurate data and battery consumption soon however the app proved its mettle in multiple pilot programs and caught the attention of

untraceable communication guaranteedshare december larry hardesty mit news new untraceable text messaging system comes with statistical guarantees tor operates under the assumption that there s not a global adversary that s paying attention to every single link in the world nickolai zeldovich says maybe these days this is not as good of an assumption image mit news anonymity networks which sit on top of the public internet are designed to conceal people s web browsing habits from prying eyes the most popular of these tor has been around for more than a decade and is used by millions of people every day recent research however has shown that adversaries can infer a great deal about the sources of supposedly anonymous communications by monitoring data traffic through just a few well chosen nodes in an anonymity network at the association for computing machinery symposium on operating systems principles in october a team of mit researchers presented a new untraceable text messaging system designed to thwart even the most powerful of adversaries the system provides a strong mathematical guarantee of user anonymity while according to experimental results permitting the exchange of text messages once a minute or so tor operates under the assumption that there s not a global adversary that s paying attention to every single link in the world says nickolai zeldovich an associate professor of computer science and engineering whose group developed the new system maybe these days this is not as good of an assumption tor also assumes that no single bad guy controls a large number of nodes in their system we re also now thinking maybe there are people who can compromise half of your servers because the system confuses adversaries by drowning telltale traffic patterns in spurious information or noise its creators have dubbed it vuvuzela after the noisemakers favored by soccer fans at the world cup in south africa joining zeldovich on the paper are joint first authors david lazar a phd student in electrical engineering and computer science and jelle van den hoof who received his mit master s in the spring and matei zaharia an assistant professor of computer science and engineering and like zeldovich one of the co leaders of the parallel and distributed operating systems group at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory covering your tracks vuvuzela is a dead drop system in which one user leaves a message for another at a predefined location in this case a memory address on an internet connected server and the other user retrieves it but it adds several layers of obfuscation to cover the users trails to illustrate how the system works lazar describes a simplified scenario in which it has only three users named by cryptographic convention alice bob and charlie alice and bob wish to exchange text messages but they don t want anyone to be able to infer that they ve been in touch if alice and bob send messages to the dead drop server and charlie doesn t then an observer would conclude that alice and bob are communicating so the system s first requirement is that all users send regular messages to the server whether they contain any information or not if an adversary has infiltrated the server however he or she can see which users are accessing which memory addresses if charlie s message is routed to one address but both alice s and bob s messages are routed to another the adversary again knows who s been talking so instead of using a single server vuvuzela uses three corresponding to the three servers every message sent through the system is wrapped in three layers of encryption the first server peels off the first layer of encryption before passing messages on to the second server but it also randomly permutes their order so if for example alice s message arrived at the first server before bob s and bob s arrived before charlie s the first server will pass them to the second in the order bob alice charlie or charlie bob alice or the like the second server peels off the second layer of encryption and permutes the message order yet again only the third server sees which messages are bound for which memory addresses but even if it s been infiltrated and even if the adversary observed the order in which the messages arrived at the first server he or she can t tell whose message ended up where the adversary does however know that two users whose messages reached the first server within some window of time have been talking and even that is more information than vuvuzela s designers want to give away here s where the noise comes in when the first server passes on the messages it s received it also manufactures a slew of dummy messages with their own encrypted destinations the second server does the same so statistically it s almost impossible for the adversary to determine even whether any of the messages arriving within the same time window ended up at the same destination those statistical guarantees hold even if two of the three servers are infiltrated as long as one of them remains uncompromised the system works in recent years one of the most interesting developments in cryptography has been the theory of differential privacy which attempts to formalize intuitions about protecting the privacy of people whose data features in large supposedly anonymized data sets the mechanism that the mit researchers use for hiding communication patterns is a very insightful and interesting application of differential privacy says michael walfish an associate professor of computer science at new york university differential privacy is a very deep and sophisticated theory the observation that you could use differential privacy to solve their problem and the way they use it is the coolest thing

basis for all cryptographyshare october larry hardesty mit news a tool that would provide a secure foundation for any cryptographic system may be close at hand indistinguishability obfuscation is a powerful concept that would yield provably secure versions of every cryptographic system we ve ever developed and all those we ve been unable to develop but nobody knows how to put it into practice last week at the ieee symposium on foundations of computer science mit researchers showed that the problem of indistinguishability obfuscation is in fact a variation on a different cryptographic problem called efficient functional encryption and while computer scientists don t know how to do efficient functional encryption either they believe that they re close much closer than they thought they were to indistinguishability obfuscation this thing has really been studied for a longer time than obfuscation and we ve had a very nice progression of results achieving better and better functional encryption schemes says nir bitansky a postdoc in mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory who wrote the conference paper together with vinod vaikuntanathan an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science people thought this is a small gap obfuscation that s another dimension it s much more powerful there s a huge gap there what we did was really narrow this gap now if you want to do obfuscation and get all of crypto everything that you can imagine from standard assumptions all that you have to do is solve this very specific problem making functional encryption just a little bit more efficient in computer science obfuscation means disguising the operational details of a computer program so that it can t be reverse engineered many obfuscation techniques have been proposed and many have been broken so computer scientists began investigating the idea theoretically the ideal obfuscation scheme would take the source code for a program and rewrite it so that it still yields a working program but it is impossible to determine what operations it was executing theorists quickly proved that ideal obfuscation would enable almost any cryptographic scheme that they could dream up but almost as quickly they proved that it was impossible there s always a way to construct a program that can t be perfectly obfuscated fuzzy details so they began investigating less stringent theoretical principles one of which was indistinguishability obfuscation rather than requiring that an adversary have no idea what operations the program is executing indistinguishability obfuscation requires only that the adversary be unable to determine which of two versions of an operation it s executing most people recall from algebra for instance that a x b c is the same thing as a x b a x c for any given values both expressions yield the same result but they d be executed differently on a computer indistinguishability obfuscation permits the adversary to determine that the program is performing one of those computations but not which for years the idea of indistinguishability obfuscation lay idle but in the last few years computer scientists have shown how to construct indistinguishability obfuscation schemes from mathematical objects called multilinear maps remarkably they also showed that even the weaker notion of indistinguishability obfuscation could yield all of cryptography but multilinear maps are not well understood and it s not clear that any of the proposed techniques for building them will offer the security guarantees that indistinguishability obfuscation requires tip of the iceberg functional encryption on the other hand has for decades been a popular research topic in cryptography it s a method for performing some operation on an encrypted file with an intelligible result but without leaking any further information about the file s contents it could for instance allow a server hosting a wealth of encrypted e mails to decrypt just the senders names for search purposes with a standard encryption scheme encryption time is proportional to the length of the file being encrypted that s what bitansky and vaikuntanathan mean by efficient but the best functional encryption schemes aren t quite that good their encryption efficiencies also include a factor proportional to the size of the result of the operation if the operation were the decryption of the sender s name that factor would be pretty small but in principle it could be much larger bitansky acknowledges that researchers may have underestimated the difficulty of eliminating that extra factor it could be that our initial view of the world was false he says maybe this is not such an easy problem maybe this is the real gap and it could take a very long time to solve but i m an optimist our current candidate constructions for io indistinguishability obfuscation are all based on very new and not well understood assumptions that may very well be broken in the near future and indeed many of them have been broken says rafael pass an associate professor of computer science at cornell university functional encryption is a significantly simpler looking primitive so this work opens a new avenue for getting secure constructions of io the technical approach is simple and beautiful and i expect it will have

credit mit news magazine in dina katabi sm phd like all syrian high school seniors took a standardized test that would determine which courses of study she was eligible for at university she finished sixth in the nation that meant she was bound for medical training the most prestigious undergraduate placement available only to the students with the highest scores on the exam moreover she says i come from a family that is all medical doctors my father is a doctor most of my aunts and uncles are doctors my grandfather is a doctor there are so many medical doctors on both sides so it was the path for me but after a year of study during which she was at the top of her class katabi had an epiphany i just decided i cannot live without math she says so she transferred into the less prestigious electrical engineering curriculum at the university of damascus that was a big fight with my parents she says twenty five years later it looks like a pretty good decision katabi now the andrew and erna viterbi professor of electrical engineering and computer science and a member of the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail is in the third year of a macarthur genius grant and just back from presenting some of her new work to president obama at the white house networking protocols based on her work have found their way into commercial products and her innovative reinterpretation of the problem of radio frequency interference is changing the way engineers design wireless networks but that doesn t mean her parents opposition was unfounded not only was medicine the more highly esteemed profession in syria but it also offered many more employment opportunities there and drew larger numbers of women syrian society at the time was pretty liberal katabi says but even so her parents worried that going into a profession with a low percentage of women would make her life harder it s something that even in the u s we feel in certain fields she says katabi estimates that only to percent of her classmates in electrical engineering were women after graduating again at the top of her class katabi came to the united states for graduate school following in the footsteps of her father who had come for his medical specialization after earning a master s in computer science at mit she enrolled in the phd program under the supervision of david clark a senior research scientist at the laboratory for computer science which has since merged with the artificial intelligence laboratory to produce csail and for most of the s the internet s chief protocol architect it became clear very quickly that she was going to do some outstanding work clark says she brought a very distinctive background because she had training in both electrical engineering and computer science so she had a broader range of skills than a lot of computer science students and that let her undertake a different set of problems katabi s dissertation was on networking protocols clark s area of expertise but she took an unusual approach a central problem in network management is congestion control throttling back transmissions when they threaten to choke the network the internet s congestion control mechanism was for each computer to monitor its own transmissions and if it detected evidence of congestion to unilaterally reduce its transmission rate that approach seemed to work in practice but it didn t have a very secure theoretical foundation katabi imported principles from control theory which analyzes the behavior of large dynamic systems into network protocol design using these principles she and her collaborators could not only design better congestion control mechanisms but also provide mathematical assurance that they d work at large scales cisco the world s largest manufacturer of networking equipment has since incorporated some of katabi s work on congestion control into one of its products and years after she defended her dissertation it won the test of time award from the association for computing machinery s network and communication group which honors past research that has proved particularly influential i would say in some sense she shifted the standard for what it takes to publish in this space clark says after she demonstrated the utility of control theory in understanding these algorithms it became much harder to successfully publish a paper without using that kind of analysis in on the strength of her dissertation mit snapped katabi up as a junior faculty member one of her first graduate teaching assignments was data communication networks which she taught with information theorist muriel m dard the cecil h green professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the time m dard had been investigating network coding which was then one of the most promising new topics in information theory with conventional internet routing if a packet of data travels from a computer in boston to a computer in california it looks exactly the same on arrival as it did on departure all the bits are in the same place each packet also follows a single determinate route through the network but if one of the links along that route is dead the packet simply won t go through with network coding a given router in the network would instead mix together the contents of packets it receives within some time window sending the combined packets out over all the links available to it if packets get held up at a congested router the router can simply drop them each recipient can then extract the information intended just for it by identifying the overlap in hybridized packets arriving over

automating big data analysisshare october larry hardesty mit news office system that replaces human intuition with algorithms outperforms of human teams image mit news big data analysis consists of searching for buried patterns that have some kind of predictive power but choosing which features of the data to analyze usually requires some human intuition in a database containing say the beginning and end dates of various sales promotions and weekly profits the crucial data may not be the dates themselves but the spans between them or not the total profits but the averages across those spans mit researchers aim to take the human element out of big data analysis with a new system that not only searches for patterns but designs the feature set too to test the first prototype of their system they enrolled it in three data science competitions in which it competed against human teams to find predictive patterns in unfamiliar data sets of the teams participating in the three competitions the researchers data science machine finished ahead of in two of the three competitions the predictions made by the data science machine were percent and percent as accurate as the winning submissions in the third the figure was a more modest percent but where the teams of humans typically labored over their prediction algorithms for months the data science machine took somewhere between two and hours to produce each of its entries we view the data science machine as a natural complement to human intelligence says max kanter whose mit master s thesis in computer science is the basis of the data science machine there s so much data out there to be analyzed and right now it s just sitting there not doing anything so maybe we can come up with a solution that will at least get us started on it at least get us moving between the lines kanter and his thesis advisor kalyan veeramachaneni a research scientist at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail describe the data science machine in a paper that kanter will present next week at the ieee international conference on data science and advanced analytics veeramachaneni co leads the anyscale learning for all group at csail which applies machine learning techniques to practical problems in big data analysis such as determining the power generation capacity of wind farm sites or predicting which students are at risk for dropping out of online courses what we observed from our experience solving a number of data science problems for industry is that one of the very critical steps is called feature engineering veeramachaneni says the first thing you have to do is identify what variables to extract from the database or compose and for that you have to come up with a lot of ideas in predicting dropout for instance two crucial indicators proved to be how long before a deadline a student begins working on a problem set and how much time the student spends on the course website relative to his or her classmates mit s online learning platform mitx doesn t record either of those statistics but it does collect data from which they can be inferred featured composition kanter and veeramachaneni use a couple of tricks to manufacture candidate features for data analyses one is to exploit structural relationships inherent in database design databases typically store different types of data in different tables indicating the correlations between them using numerical identifiers the data science machine tracks these correlations using them as a cue to feature construction for instance one table might list retail items and their costs another might list items included in individual customers purchases the data science machine would begin by importing costs from the first table into the second then taking its cue from the association of several different items in the second table with the same purchase number it would execute a suite of operations to generate candidate features total cost per order average cost per order minimum cost per order and so on as numerical identifiers proliferate across tables the data science machine layers operations on top of each other finding minima of averages averages of sums and so on it also looks for so called categorical data which appear to be restricted to a limited range of values such as days of the week or brand names it then generates further feature candidates by dividing up existing features across categories once it s produced an array of candidates it reduces their number by identifying those whose values seem to be correlated then it starts testing its reduced set of features on sample data recombining them in different ways to optimize the accuracy of the predictions they yield the data science machine is one of those unbelievable projects where applying cutting edge research to solve practical problems opens an entirely new way of looking at the problem says margo seltzer a professor of computer science at harvard university who was not involved in the work i think what they ve done is going to become the standard quickly very quickly read

predicting change in the alzheimer s brainshare october larry hardesty mit news office combining mri and other data helps machine learning systems predict effects of neurodegenerative disease mit researchers are developing a computer system that uses genetic demographic and clinical data to help predict the effects of disease on brain anatomy in experiments they trained a machine learning system on mri data from patients with neurodegenerative diseases and found that supplementing that training with other patient information improved the system s predictions in the cases of patients with drastic changes in brain anatomy the additional data cut the predictions error rate in half from percent to percent this is the first paper that we ve ever written on this says polina golland a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit and the senior author on the new paper our goal is not to prove that our model is the best model to do this kind of thing it s to prove that the information is actually in the data so what we ve done is we take our model and we turn off the genetic information and the demographic and clinical information and we see that with combined information we can predict anatomical changes better first author on the paper is adrian dalca an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and a member of golland s group at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory they re joined by ramesh sridharan another phd student in golland s group and by mert sabuncu an assistant professor of radiology at massachusetts general hospital who was a postdoc in golland s group the researchers are presenting the paper at the international conference on medical image computing and computer assisted intervention this week the work is a project of the neuroimage analysis center which is based at brigham and women s hospital in boston and funded by the national institutes of health common denominator in their experiments the researchers used data from the alzheimer s disease neuroimaging initiative a longitudinal study on neurodegenerative disease that includes mri scans of the same subjects taken months and years apart each scan is represented as a three dimensional model consisting of millions of tiny cubes or voxels the d equivalent of image pixels the researchers first step is to produce a generic brain template by averaging the voxel values of hundreds of randomly selected mri scans they then characterize each scan in the training set for their machine learning algorithm as a deformation of the template each subject in the training set is represented by two scans taken between six months and seven years apart the researchers conducted two experiments one in which they trained their system on scans of both healthy subjects and those displaying evidence of either alzheimer s disease or mild cognitive impairment and one in which they trained it only on data from healthy subjects in the first experiment they trained the system twice once using just the mri scans and the second time supplementing them with additional information this included data on genetic markers known as single nucleotide polymorphisms demographic data such as subject age gender marital status and education level and rudimentary clinical data such as patients scores on various cognitive tests the brains of healthy subjects and subjects in the early stages of neurodegenerative disease change little over time and indeed in cases where the differences between a subject s scans were slight the system trained only on mri data fared well in cases where the changes were more marked however the addition of the supplementary data made a significant difference counterfactuals in the second experiment the researchers trained the system just once on both the mri data and the supplementary data of healthy subjects but they instead used it to predict what the brains of alzheimer s patients would have looked like had they not been disfigured by disease in this case there are no clinical data that could validate the system s predictions but the researchers believe that exploring this sort of counterfactual could be scientifically useful it would illuminate how changes in individual subjects for example with mild cognitive impairment which is a precursor to alzheimer s evolve along this trajectory of degeneration as compared to what normal degeneration would be golland says we think that there are very interesting research applications of this but i have to be honest and say that the original motivation was curiosity about how much of anatomy we could predict from genetics and other non image data it s not surprising that clinical and genetic data would help says bruce rosen a professor of radiology at harvard medical school and director of the athinoula a martinos center for biomedical imaging at massachusetts general hospital but the fact that it did as well as it did is encouraging there are lots of ways these tools could be beneficial to the research community rosen adds to my mind the more challenging question is whether they could be useful clinically some promising experimental alzheimer s drugs require early determination of how the disease is likely to progress rosen says currently he says that determination relies on a combination of mri and pet scan data people think mri is expensive but it s only a fraction of what pet scans cost rosen says if machine learning tools can help avoid the need for pet scans in evaluating patients early in the disease course that will be very impactful read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

courtesy of censio are you a safe driver according to mit alumnus brad cordova sm co founder of driving data analytics startup censio you ll probably answer yes but the real answer may be no those who consider themselves safe drivers may tailgate speed or use cellphones while driving which significantly increase the probability of an accident cordova says for most of us the most dangerous thing you do from day to day is driving he says to improve driver safety censio has developed an app that captures and analyzes data on driving behavior to show drivers where they can improve in september progressive insurance began piloting the app with customers nationwide with aims of reducing insurance rates for good drivers in a way the app acts as a sort of external brain for drivers cordova says helping them see the risks associated with certain driving behaviors especially distracted driving the human brain is not good at statistics and probability so most people aren t thinking how sending this text will affect their probability of getting into an accident he says we calculate these complicated probability distributions and send that back to the app in a very digestible way the national highway traffic safety administration attributes one accident every seconds in the united states to distracted driving the national safety council estimates that million crashes annually are due to cellphone use with another million due to texting while driving beyond safety there s also a monetary incentive the startup hopes to shift insurers toward user based insurance programs where rates are based on how well a person drives those policies could lower rates for the million insured drivers across the united states censio president kevin farrell says but are being held back by the logistics and costs of introducing hardware into cars we believe bringing an app into the market really opens things up he says breaking bad driving habits to capture driving behavior the app identifies when a person is driving not for instance in the backseat of a cab and then uses a smartphone s accelerometer gyroscope positioning and gps to track driving dynamics added to that is external data such as on speed limit weather and street information such as on safe or dangerous intersections using this data the app looks for habits such as speeding through intersections and braking hard which could indicate tailgating or not paying attention to the road it also observes cellphone use while driving analyzing all this data the app then scores the driver on a score of to and keeps track of the habits a driver has or may need to improve upon scores are also compared with other drivers across the nation a user for instance may brake hard more frequently or pick up their phone less often than the national average that data are shared with insurers to help them assess the overall risk of a particular driver behind the scenes cordova says the app earned the business of progressive over competitors because it doesn t drain a phone s battery and is as accurate as a hardware based solution beating battery drain cordova says came down to developing optimization algorithms that collect data only when needed and shut off when not collecting data gaining accuracy he says was about cleaning up messy data when the data comes in from the car it s extremely noisy cordova says a lot of the engineering effort went into better signal processing and machine learning to clean up those signals driven by social change leaving an engineering position at cern in cordova came to mit as a phd student in electrical engineering and computer science with aims of making a social difference he left after completing his master s degree to pursue censio while taking new ventures he met censio co founder and current vice president of operations joe adelmann a harvard university student who shared his inclination toward social change inspired to launch a startup cordova and adelmann designed a system that used a smartphone to alert people who fall asleep at the wheel mounting the camera on the windshield the camera would track the road and the app would calculate various driving data such as braking frequency and vehicle positioning that system wasn t exactly practical but at its core was an app that could collect movement and driving data as a test several mit students downloaded the app to their phones and it accurately predicted if the students were walking sitting at a desk or climbing stairs and when they were about to get in a car and drive but that app drained a phone s battery with a day of use as an engineer you try to make the most awesome product but you miss something like battery life cordova says we had to go back to the drawing board after much refining the end product was a prototype for the censio app that collected necessary data in the background to let drivers know the risks of their behavior this prototype landed cordova and adelmann a finalist spot in mit s k entrepreneurship competition in they further developed the business in office space in the martin trust center for mit entrepreneurship and harvard s innovation lab where they met co founder jon mcneill an entrepreneur with prior experience in the insurance industry and co founder scott griffith former ceo of zipcar three years later the startup earned its initial funding round of

joined on the paper by barzilay who s his thesis advisor and by fellow first author tejas kulkarni a graduate student in the group of josh tenenbaum a professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences they presented the paper last week at the empirical methods in natural language processing conference gordian not the researchers were particularly concerned with designing a system that could make inferences about syntax which has been a perennial problem in the field of natural language processing take negation for example in a text based fantasy game there s a world of difference between being told you re hurt and you re not hurt but a system that just relied on collections of keywords as a guide to action would miss that distinction so the researchers designed their own text based computer game that though very simple tended to describe states of affairs using troublesome syntactical constructions such as negation and conjunction they also tested their system against a demonstration game built by the developers of evennia a game creation toolkit a human could probably complete it in about minutes kulkarni says to evaluate their system the researchers compared its performance to that of two others which use variants of a technique standard in the field of natural language processing the basic technique is called the bag of words in which a machine learning algorithm bases its outputs on the co occurrence of words the variation called the bag of bigrams which looks for the co occurrence of two word units on the evennia game the mit researchers system outperformed systems based on both bags of words and bags of bigrams but on the homebrewed game with its syntactical ambiguities the difference in performance was even more dramatic what we created is adversarial to actually test language understanding narasimhan says deep learning the mit researchers used an approach to machine learning called deep learning a revival of the concept of neural networks which was a staple of early artificial intelligence research typically a machine learning system will begin with some assumptions about the data it s examining to prevent wasted time on fruitless hypotheses a natural language processing system could for example assume that some of the words it encounters will be negation words though it has no idea which words those are neural networks make no such assumptions instead they derive a sense of direction from their organization into layers data are fed into an array of processing nodes in the bottom layer of the network each of which modifies the data in a different way before passing it to the next layer which modifies it before passing it to the next layer and so on the output of the final layer is measured against some performance criterion and then the process repeats to see whether different modifications improve performance in their experiments the researchers used two performance criteria one was completion of a task in the evennia game crossing a bridge without falling off for instance the other was maximization of a score that factored in several player attributes tracked by the game such as health points and magic points on both measures the deep learning system outperformed bags of words and bags of bigrams successfully completing the evennia game however requires the player to remember a verbal description of an engraving encountered in one room and then after navigating several intervening challenges match it up with a different description of the same engraving in a different room we don t know how to do that at all kulkarni says i think this paper is quite nice and that the general area of mapping natural language to actions is an interesting and important area says percy liang an assistant professor of computer science and statistics at stanford university who was not involved in the work it would be interesting to see how far you can scale up these approaches to more complex domains read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

personalized heart models for surgical planningshare september larry hardesty mit news office system can convert mri scans into d printed physical models in a few hours new system from mit and boston children s hospital researchers converts mri scans into d printed heart models shown here photo bryce vickmark researchers at mit and boston children s hospital have developed a system that can take mri scans of a patient s heart and in a matter of hours convert them into a tangible physical model that surgeons can use to plan surgery the models could provide a more intuitive way for surgeons to assess and prepare for the anatomical idiosyncrasies of individual patients our collaborators are convinced that this will make a difference says polina golland a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit who led the project the phrase i heard is that surgeons see with their hands that the perception is in the touch this fall seven cardiac surgeons at boston children s hospital will participate in a study intended to evaluate the models usefulness golland and her colleagues will describe their new system at the international conference on medical image computing and computer assisted intervention in october danielle pace an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science is first author on the paper and spearheaded the development of the software that analyzes the mri scans medhi moghari a physicist at boston children s hospital developed new procedures that increase the precision of mri scans tenfold and andrew powell a cardiologist at the hospital leads the project s clinical work the work was funded by both boston children s hospital and by harvard catalyst a consortium aimed at rapidly moving scientific innovation into the clinic mri data consist of a series of cross sections of a three dimensional object like a black and white photograph each cross section has regions of dark and light and the boundaries between those regions may indicate the edges of anatomical structures then again they may not determining the boundaries between distinct objects in an image is one of the central problems in computer vision known as image segmentation but general purpose image segmentation algorithms aren t reliable enough to produce the very precise models that surgical planning requires human factors typically the way to make an image segmentation algorithm more precise is to augment it with a generic model of the object to be segmented human hearts for instance have chambers and blood vessels that are usually in roughly the same places relative to each other that anatomical consistency could give a segmentation algorithm a way to weed out improbable conclusions about object boundaries the problem with that approach is that many of the cardiac patients at boston children s hospital require surgery precisely because the anatomy of their hearts is irregular inferences from a generic model could obscure the very features that matter most to the surgeon in the past researchers have produced printable models of the heart by manually indicating boundaries in mri scans but with the or so cross sections in one of moghari s high precision scans that process can take eight to hours they want to bring the kids in for scanning and spend probably a day or two doing planning of how exactly they re going to operate golland says if it takes another day just to process the images it becomes unwieldy pace and golland s solution was to ask a human expert to identify boundaries in a few of the cross sections and allow algorithms to take over from there their strongest results came when they asked the expert to segment only a small patch one ninth of the total area of each cross section in that case segmenting just patches and letting the algorithm infer the rest yielded percent agreement with expert segmentation of the entire collection of cross sections human segmentation of just three patches yielded percent agreement i think that if somebody told me that i could segment the whole heart from eight slices out of i would not have believed them golland says it was a surprise to us together human segmentation of sample patches and the algorithmic generation of a digital d heart model takes about an hour the d printing process takes a couple of hours more prognosis currently the algorithm examines patches of unsegmented cross sections and looks for similar features in the nearest segmented cross sections but golland believes that its performance might be improved if it also examined patches that ran obliquely across several cross sections this and other variations on the algorithm are the subject of ongoing research the clinical study in the fall will involve mris from patients who have already received treatment at boston children s hospital each of seven surgeons will be given data on all patients some probably more than once that data will include the raw mri scans and on a randomized basis either a physical model or a computerized d model based again at random on either human segmentations or algorithmic segmentations using that data the surgeons will draw up surgical plans which will be compared with documentation of the interventions that were performed on each of the patients the hope is that the study will shed light on whether d printed physical models can actually improve surgical outcomes absolutely a d model would indeed help says sitaram emani a cardiac surgeon at boston children s hospital who is not a co author on the new paper we have used this type of model in a few patients and in fact performed virtual surgery on the heart to simulate real conditions doing this really helped with the real surgery in terms of reducing the amount of time spent examining the heart and performing the repair i think having this will also

accidents could autonomous cars be part of the solution today mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail announced a new million research center funded by toyota to further the development of autonomous vehicle technologies with the goal of reducing traffic casualties and potentially even developing a vehicle incapable of getting into an accident announced at a press conference in california the toyota csail joint research center will be part of a combined million that toyota has committed to dual centers at mit and stanford university to advance the state of autonomous systems led by csail director daniela rus the new center will focus on developing advanced decision making algorithms and systems that allow vehicles to perceive and navigate their surroundings safely without human input we are excited to mark the start of our partnership with toyota and hopefully the beginning of the end for traffic fatalities says rus the andrew and erna viterbi professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science together we have developed some research directions that have the potential to be game changers in the field and we look forward to working closely with toyota and stanford to make them real toyota s larger academic collaboration with mit and stanford will be coordinated by gill pratt phd a former mit professor who most recently served as program director at the defense advanced research project agency darpa s defense sciences office the toyota csail joint research center traditionally companies have focused on developing systems in which either the human driver must pay attention and be ready to take control or one in which an automated system is always in control of the vehicle csail researchers plan to start by exploring a new alternative approach in which the human driver pays attention at all times with an autonomous system that is there to jump in to save the driver in the event of an unavoidable accident this type of system could not only improve safety by reducing the number of accidents but could also enhance the overall driving experience rus explains she envisions creating a system that could prevent collisions and also provide drivers with assistance navigating tricky situations support a tired driver by watching for unexpected dangers and diversions and even offer helpful tips such as letting the driver know she is out of milk at home and planning a new route home that allows the driver to swing by the grocery store a highly advanced system like this would be a major advance in the field of autonomy and an important step on the way to creating a safer world for drivers rus says on the technical front csail s new center will focus on pressing challenges in autonomy from computer vision and perception to planning and control to decision making taking on the moonshot challenges research at the new center will be aimed at improving vehicular transportation by advancing the science of autonomous systems researchers will tackle challenges integral to the development of advanced automated vehicle systems including building new tools for collecting and analyzing navigation data with the goal of learning from human driving creating perception and decision making systems for safe navigation developing predictive models that can anticipate the behavior of humans vehicles and the larger environment inventing state of the art tools to handle congestion and high speed driving in challenging situations including adverse weather improving machine vision algorithms used to detect and classify objects and creating more intelligent user interfaces among the csail principal investigators involved will be john leonard the samuel c collins professor in mit s department of mechanical engineering who has pioneered algorithms that allow robots to navigate unknown environments and russ tedrake an associate professor of computer science and engineering who oversaw mit s darpa robotics challenge team the researchers say that they are eager to work on solutions that could completely transform the way that humans get around solving these challenges will

self driving golf cartsshare september larry hardesty mit news office autonomous vehicles share sidewalk space with pedestrians in six day trial in singaporean public garden image the autonomous golf carts shown here deployed in the singapore public gardens relied on just a few unobtrusive sensors screenshot from video provided by smart at the international conference on intelligent robots and systems in september members of the singapore mit alliance for research and technology smart and their colleagues will describe an experiment conducted over six days at a large public garden in singapore in which self driving golf carts ferried tourists around winding paths trafficked by pedestrians bicyclists and the occasional monitor lizard the experiments also tested an online booking system that enabled visitors to schedule pickups and drop offs at any of distinct stations scattered around the garden automatically routing and redeploying the vehicles to accommodate all the requests we would like to use robot cars to make transportation available to everyone says daniela rus the andrew and erna viterbi professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science and a senior author on the conference paper the idea is if you need a ride you make a booking maybe using your smartphone or maybe on the internet and the car just comes the researchers asked participants in the experiment to fill out a brief questionnaire after their rides some percent said that they would use the autonomous golf carts again and percent said that they would be more likely to visit the gardens if the golf carts were a permanent fixture smart is a collaboration between mit and the national research foundation of singapore with lead researchers drawn from both mit and several singaporean universities chiefly the national university of singapore and the singapore university of technology and design the program offers four year graduate fellowships that cover tuition for students at the affiliated schools as well as undergraduate and postdoctoral research fellowships joining rus on the paper are emilio frazzoli a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at mit marcelo ang an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the national university of singapore and smart students postdocs and staff members from both the u s and asia less is more what distinguishes the smart program s autonomous vehicles is that we are taking a minimalist solution to the self driving car problem rus says the vehicles are instrumented but they are not as heavily instrumented as the darpa vehicles competitors in the u s defense advanced research projects agency s autonomous vehicle challenge were nor as heavily instrumented as say the google car we believe that if you have a simple suite of strategically placed sensors and augment that with reliable algorithms you will get robust results that require less computation and have less of a chance to get confused by fusing sensors or situations where one sensor says one thing and another sensor says something different accordingly the golf carts sensors consist entirely of off the shelf laser rangefinders mounted at different heights since unlike the more sophisticated rangefinders deployed in some other autonomous vehicles they measure distance only in a plane and a camera algorithmically one of the keys to the system is what the researchers call the dynamic virtual bumper which can be thought of as a cylinder surrounding the vehicle s planned trajectory the width and length of the cylinder are a function of the vehicle s velocity when an obstacle enters the cylinder the vehicle s onboard computer redraws the cylinder to exclude it that could mean changing the trajectory reducing the velocity or both the short run in the experiments the golf carts received no special treatment they jockeyed for position on the garden s paths along with everyone else but according to rus the obstacle collision system encountered only one difficulty when a large slow moving monitor lizard crossed the path of one of the golf carts it was this stop and go game over who s going to do what rus says of course the golf carts had the advantage of moving relatively slowly a top speed of only about mph which gave their algorithms more time to process sensor data and recalculate trajectories but while the experiment was envisioned chiefly as a step on the path toward self driving cars rus says that relatively slow autonomous golf carts could have their own practical applications if you think about who needs rides she says it s fast enough for the elderly population who no longer have a driver s license and live in special areas where maybe their friend lives a mile away and that s too far to walk if they want to go to the doctor or shopping they can use the self driving golf carts because that s within some comfortable distance the cart was a joy to ride in says matt mason a professor of computer science and robotics at carnegie mellon university who was one of the carts passengers during the trial it drove all over the place it avoided all the obstacles

study identifies new cheating method in moocsshare august abby abazorius mit news research from mit and harvard shows how to exploit and protect mooc certification illustration jose luis olivares mit while the proliferation of massive open online courses moocs has expanded learning opportunities for individuals around the world the digital classroom is also subject to many of the same issues as the traditional one such as cheating in a new working paper researchers at mit and harvard university identify a new method of cheating specific to open online courses and recommend a number of strategies that prove effective in preventing such cheating the working paper detecting and preventing multiple account cheating in massive open online courses was published today on arxiv org an online repository for electronic preprints isaac chuang a professor of electrical engineering and physics senior associate dean of digital learning at mit and one of the authors of the working paper explains that he and his colleagues were inspired to examine the problem in an effort to better understand all the opportunities that online courses provide including both learning and cheating if learners in some online courses are circumventing the learning process and obtaining certification without going through the traditional routes of assessment and feedback then the certification does not necessarily imply that they learned anything this could seriously devalue mooc certification chuang says this is a well known issue in academics and it s happening in a new ways in online settings we want to understand and address this issue as online education continues to grow andrew ho a professor at the harvard graduate school of education and an author of the working paper adds that the paper describes a new cheating technique that is particular to moocs it is enabled by specific design features including the ability to create multiple accounts for free this is a method of cheating that allows you to acquire a certification for a course in an hour which is not possible through conventional cheating approaches this is cheating of a different kind cameo users while analyzing data gathered from learners using the edx online learning platform the researchers noticed that certain users were answering assessment questions faster than is humanly possible according to chuang upon further examination the researchers realized that a number of learners appeared to be employing a cheating strategy they refer to as copying answers using multiple existences online or cameo in this method of cheating a user creates multiple accounts one of which is the primary account that will ultimately earn a certificate the other accounts are used to find or harvest the correct answers to assessment questions for the master account to determine the amount of cheating occurring in classes where learners can obtain certification for passing the course the researchers developed a new algorithm that can identify cameo users the algorithm searches for pairs of related accounts in which one account responds to most of the answers incorrectly and the other provides mostly correct answers on the first attempt activity time stamps are then reviewed to see when the account suspected of harvesting answers solved a particular problem just after the master account did the algorithm also looks to see whether related accounts might share ip addresses across multiple courses the researchers examined data gathered from million course participants in moocs offered by harvardx and mitx from the fall of through the spring of they discovered that in courses where users were found to have been employing the cameo strategy percent of the certificates earned certificates appeared to have been obtained through such cheating additionally they found that among earners of or more certificates percent appear to have used the cameo strategy in some courses cameo users may account for as many as percent of certificates earned although these percentages are lower than the prevalence of reported cheating which by some accounts is greater than percent the authors argue that these percentages are nonetheless significant this is not an isolated incident of copying on part of one assignment ho says this is the wholesale falsification of a certificate cameo usage was found to be higher among young less educated males outside the united states the rate among users from the united states was particularly low at percent of certificates earned the authors observe that these rates may correlate with the perceived value of the certificate across different countries the prevalence of cameo usage was highest in government health and social science courses where percent of certificates were earned by employing the cameo strategy and lowest in computer science courses where just percent of certificates were obtained using the technique prevention techniques the authors outline a number of strategies to prevent cheating in online courses including restricting solutions to assessments until after assignments are due and randomizing questions so that each learner receives a customized set of problems however some of these strategies are costly or may limit learning opportunities we may face a tradeoff between enabling learning and preventing cheating chuang notes the researchers found that in the science technology engineering and mathematics stem courses where such techniques may have been employed cameo usage accounted for just percent of certificates earned as opposed to percent of certificates earned in courses that did not use any prevention strategies while techniques including randomization are easy to employ in stem courses chuang notes that they are more challenging to implement in humanities courses where multiple choice questions are commonly used as part of the assessment process nonetheless the researchers are hopeful that their findings will inspire course content creators to implement some of the prevention strategies they have outlined and that this research will inspire further evaluation of cheating in moocs one of the most interesting lessons from the paper is that there are ways to mitigate cheating that are straightforward and implementable

shoring up torshare july larry hardesty mit news researchers mount successful attacks against popular anonymity network and show how to prevent them image istock with million daily users the tor network is the world s most popular system for protecting internet users anonymity for more than a decade people living under repressive regimes have used tor to conceal their web browsing habits from electronic surveillance and websites hosting content that s been deemed subversive have used it to hide the locations of their servers researchers at mit and the qatar computing research institute qcri have now demonstrated a vulnerability in tor s design at the usenix security symposium this summer they show that an adversary could infer a hidden server s location or the source of the information reaching a given tor user by analyzing the traffic patterns of encrypted data passing through a single computer in the all volunteer tor network fortunately the same paper also proposes defenses which representatives of the tor project say they are evaluating for possible inclusion in future versions of the tor software anonymity is considered a big part of freedom of speech now says albert kwon an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and one of the paper s first authors the internet engineering task force is trying to develop a human rights standard for the internet and as part of their definition of freedom of expression they include anonymity if you re fully anonymous you can say what you want about an authoritarian government without facing persecution layer upon layer sitting atop the ordinary internet the tor network consists of internet connected computers on which users have installed the tor software if a tor user wants to say anonymously view the front page of the new york times his or her computer will wrap a web request in several layers of encryption and send it to another tor enabled computer which is selected at random that computer known as the guard will peel off the first layer of encryption and forward the request to another randomly selected computer in the network that computer peels off the next layer of encryption and so on the last computer in the chain called the exit peels off the final layer of encryption exposing the request s true destination the times the guard knows the internet address of the sender and the exit knows the internet address of the destination site but no computer in the chain knows both this routing scheme with its successive layers of encryption is known as onion routing and it gives the network its name tor is an acronym for the onion router in addition to anonymous internet browsing however tor also offers what it calls hidden services a hidden service protects the anonymity of not just the browser but the destination site too say for instance that someone in iran wishes to host a site archiving news reports from western media but doesn t want it on the public internet using the tor software the host s computer identifies tor routers that it will use as introduction points for anyone wishing to access its content it broadcasts the addresses of those introduction points to the network without revealing its own location if another tor user wants to browse the hidden site both his or her computer and the host s computer build tor secured links to the introduction point creating what the tor project calls a circuit using the circuit the browser and host identify yet another router in the tor network known as a rendezvous point and build a second circuit through it the location of the rendezvous point unlike that of the introduction point is kept private traffic fingerprinting kwon devised an attack on this system with joint first author mashael alsabah an assistant professor of computer science at qatar university a researcher at qcri and this year a visiting scientist at mit srini devadas the edwin sibley webster professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science david lazar another graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and qcri s marc dacier the researchers attack requires that the adversary s computer serve as the guard on a tor circuit since guards are selected at random if an adversary connects enough computers to the tor network the odds are high that at least on some occasions one or another of them would be well positioned to snoop during the establishment of a circuit computers on the tor network have to pass a lot of data back and forth the researchers showed that simply by looking for patterns in the number of packets passing in each direction through a guard machine learning algorithms could with percent accuracy determine whether the circuit was an ordinary web browsing circuit an introduction point circuit or a rendezvous point circuit breaking tor s encryption wasn t necessary furthermore by using a tor enabled computer to connect to a range of different hidden services they showed that a similar analysis of traffic patterns could identify those services with percent accuracy that means that an adversary who lucked into the position of guard for a computer hosting a hidden service could with percent certainty identify it as the service s host similarly a spy who lucked into the position of guard for a user could with percent accuracy tell which sites the user was accessing to defend against this type of attack we recommend that they mask the sequences so that all the sequences look the same alsabah says you send dummy packets to make all five types of circuits look similar for a while we ve been aware that circuit fingerprinting is a big issue for hidden services says david goulet a developer with the tor project this paper showed that it s possible

object recognition for robotsshare july larry hardesty mit news office robots maps of their environments can make existing object recognition algorithms more accurate image the proposed slam aware object recognition system is able to localize and recognize several objects in the scene aggregating detection evidence across multiple views the annotations are actual predictions proposed by the system courtesy of the researchers john leonard s group in the mit department of mechanical engineering specializes in slam or simultaneous localization and mapping the technique whereby mobile autonomous robots map their environments and determine their locations last week at the robotics science and systems conference members of leonard s group presented a new paper demonstrating how slam can be used to improve object recognition systems which will be a vital component of future robots that have to manipulate the objects around them in arbitrary ways the system uses slam information to augment existing object recognition algorithms its performance should thus continue to improve as computer vision researchers develop better recognition software and roboticists develop better slam software considering object recognition as a black box and considering slam as a black box how do you integrate them in a nice manner asks sudeep pillai a graduate student in computer science and engineering and first author on the new paper how do you incorporate probabilities from each viewpoint over time that s really what we wanted to achieve despite working with existing slam and object recognition algorithms however and despite using only the output of an ordinary video camera the system s performance is already comparable to that of special purpose robotic object recognition systems that factor in depth measurements as well as visual information and of course because the system can fuse information captured from different camera angles it fares much better than object recognition systems trying to identify objects in still images drawing boundaries before hazarding a guess about which objects an image contains pillai says newer object recognition systems first try to identify the boundaries between objects on the basis of a preliminary analysis of color transitions they ll divide an image into rectangular regions that probably contain objects of some sort then they ll run a recognition algorithm on just the pixels inside each rectangle to get a good result a classical object recognition system may have to redraw those rectangles thousands of times from some perspectives for instance two objects standing next to each other might look like one particularly if they re similarly colored the system would have to test the hypothesis that lumps them together as well as hypotheses that treat them as separate because a slam map is three dimensional however it does a better job of distinguishing objects that are near each other than single perspective analysis can the system devised by pillai and leonard a professor of mechanical and ocean engineering uses the slam map to guide the segmentation of images captured by its camera before feeding them to the object recognition algorithm it thus wastes less time on spurious hypotheses more important the slam data let the system correlate the segmentation of images captured from different perspectives analyzing image segments that likely depict the same objects from different angles improves the system s performance picture perfect using machine learning other researchers have built object recognition systems that act directly on detailed d slam maps built from data captured by cameras such as the microsoft kinect that also make depth measurements but unlike those systems pillai and leonard s system can exploit the vast body of research on object recognizers trained on single perspective images captured by standard cameras moreover the performance of pillai and leonard s system is already comparable to that of the systems that use depth information and it s much more reliable outdoors where depth sensors like the kinect s which depend on infrared light are virtually useless pillai and leonard s new paper describes how slam can help improve object detection but in ongoing work pillai is investigating whether object detection can similarly aid slam one of the central challenges in slam is what roboticists call loop closure as a robot builds a map of its environment it may find itself somewhere it s already been entering a room say from a different door the robot needs to be able to recognize previously visited locations so that it can fuse mapping data acquired from different perspectives object recognition could help with that problem if a robot enters a room to find a conference table with a laptop a coffee mug and a notebook at one end of it it could infer that it s the same conference room where it previously identified a laptop a coffee mug and a notebook in close proximity the ability to detect objects is extremely important for robots that should perform useful tasks in everyday environments says dieter fox a professor of computer science and engineering at the university of washington this work shows very promising results on how a robot can combine information observed from multiple viewpoints to achieve efficient and robust

siting wind farms more quickly cheaplyshare july larry hardesty mit news new model predicts wind speeds more accurately with three months of data than others do with image jose luis olivares when a power company wants to build a new wind farm it generally hires a consultant to make wind speed measurements at the proposed site for eight to months those measurements are correlated with historical data and used to assess the site s power generation capacity at the international joint conference on artificial intelligence later this month mit researchers will present a new statistical technique that yields better wind speed predictions than existing techniques do even when it uses only three months worth of data that could save power companies time and money particularly in the evaluation of sites for offshore wind farms where maintaining measurement stations is particularly costly we talked with people in the wind industry and we found that they were using a very very simplistic mechanism to estimate the wind resource at a site says kalyan veeramachaneni a research scientist at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail and first author on the new paper in particular veeramachaneni says standard practice in the industry is to assume that wind speed data follows a so called gaussian distribution the bell curve familiar from basic statistics the data here is non gaussian we all know that veeramachaneni says you can fit a bell curve to it but that s not an accurate representation of the data typically a wind energy consultant will find correlations between wind speed measurements at a proposed site and those made during the same period at a nearby weather station where records stretch back for decades on the basis of those correlations the consultant will adjust the weather station s historical data to provide an approximation of wind speeds at the new site the correlation model is what s known in statistics as a joint distribution that means that it represents the probability not only of a particular measurement at one site but of that measurement s coincidence with a particular measurement at the other wind industry consultants veeramachaneni says usually characterize that joint distribution as a gaussian distribution different curves the first novelty of the model that veeramachaneni developed with his colleagues una may o reilly a principal research scientist at csail and alfredo cuesta infante of the universidad rey juan carlos in madrid is that it can factor in data from more than one weather station in some of their analyses the researchers used data from or more other sites but its main advantage is that it s not restricted to gaussian probability distributions moreover it can use different types of distributions to characterize data from different sites and it can combine them in different ways it can even use so called nonparametric distributions in which the data are described not by a mathematical function but by a collection of samples much the way a digital music file consists of discrete samples of a continuous sound wave another aspect of the model is that it can find nonlinear correlations between data sets standard regression analysis of the type commonly used in the wind industry identifies the straight line that best approximates a scattering of data points according to some distance measure but often a curved line would offer a better approximation the researchers model allows for that possibility validation the researchers first applied their technique to data collected from an anemometer on top of the mit museum which was looking to install a wind turbine on its roof once they had evidence of their model s accuracy they applied it to data provided to them by a major consultant in the wind industry with only three months of the company s historical data for a particular wind farm site veeramachaneni and his colleagues were able to predict wind speeds over the next two years three times as accurately as existing models could with eight months of data since then the researchers have improved their model by evaluating alternative ways of calculating joint distributions according to additional analysis of the data from the museum of science which is reported in the new paper their revised approach could double the accuracy of their predictions justin dauwels an assistant professor of electrical engineering at nanyang technological university is an expert on copulas the statistical technique the mit researchers used to couple different types of probability distributions veeramachaneni s team proposed a model that is eminently well suited for a significant real world application dauwels says by accurately describing the non gaussian statistics the copula based models outshine classical gaussian models providing accurate marginal distributions at the test locations from far fewer measurements this methodology has strong practical value and i am convinced that it will be applicable to many other real life problems read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts

what buyers wantshare july rob matheson mit news mit professors choice modeling software predicts customer preferences for retailers image istock u s retail chains often rely on intuition in choosing which products from a vast inventory will sell best at stores across the nation now mit spinout celect is refining this process with novel data analytics revealing interesting insights into how retailers can optimize their shelf space co founded by mit professors vivek farias and devavrat shah celect develops software that crunches a store s sales and inventory data and sometimes online buying data to determine which products local customers want to buy powered by the professors algorithms for improving netflix s recommendation engine and predicting trending twitter topics the software compares items located near each other in an individual store and statistically finds which will sell better based on sales records analyzed at scale over thousands or millions of product comparisons this shows the buying preferences of customers as a population we basically create a bag of comparisons and convert that into a black box known as our customer choice engine says shah an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and chief science officer at celect retailers then plug budget shipping and other parameters into the software s interface the software takes these into consideration while analyzing the assortment and prices of items in the store shelf space and other parameters to find the optimal mix of items to stock results will indicate how many items will sell and the overall profit an expensive item with a low likelihood to sell for instance may be marginally better for the bottom line than a low cost top seller it s very complicated behind the scenes but at the end of the day it s doing something very simple tracking who wants to buy what and matching the product with the person says farias the robert n noyce career development associate professor at the mit sloan school of management and celect s chief technology officer insightful data launched in celect now has eight big name retail clients some with several hundred stores across the nation last month it raised its first round of million from venture capitalists so far celect s software has provided some interesting insights into why products may or may not move off the shelves recently a midwest retailer using celect learned that it needed to stock of all things church hats using celect software the retailer s analysts noticed people buying soccer shorts and certain watches in some stores were also buying fancy hats for church church hats weren t on sale at one particular store so the chain stocked those hats which sold rapidly now the retailer plans to incorporate the software across its branches nationwide this type of insight is possible through comparisons between sales data in different stores shah explains say for example store a and store b stock many similar items but store a stocks one extra item not found in store b celect may find customers have very similar buying patterns in stores a and b but are also buying that extra item in store a we can extrapolate that people in store a will have similar buying preferences on that absent product shah says if the connection is strong enough we recommend that missing item be stocked more recently another retailer using celect assumed that because a certain article of clothing was old it sold less than newer clothing but celect s data analysis revealed that this was not the case the popularity of the item depended entirely on its color the popular colors were grabbed up quickly while the less popular colors remained on the shelves for months those kind of features just pop out of the data farias says world of choices celect s core technology traces back a decade to when farias and shah sought to improve recommendation engines used by pandora netflix and other online services by predicting preferences based on paired comparisons of movies and products in a series of papers from to farias and shah described an algorithm that used this choice model as opposed to say a five star scale used by netflix to better predict people s preferences in they used the algorithm to predict trending topics on twitter topics with percent accuracy up to four or five hours before they trended but a case study published in in management science demonstrated the algorithm s potential for real world commercial application by better predicting car buying preferences in that study farias shah and colleagues collected transaction data over months on a specific suv offered at dealerships across the midwest this data included the time of sale and the descriptions including color and features of the car sold and other cars on the lot at that time the algorithm predicted the conversion rate turning an arriving customer into a buying customer about to percent better than two other choice models the algorithms relied on building a choice model predicting the assortment of cars that needed to be on the lot along with the suvs in order to get customers to buy from there it was an easy transition to retail where paired comparisons are plentiful and technology is lacking farias says we realized this is not an issue that has to do with just cars but fundamental to all choices he says but to develop the software for clients the researchers needed to simplify because computing millions of comparisons would be too complex for a personal computer to do so the data uses a subset the smallest group of orderings that fit the available data of choice patterns from that it can winnow down the orderings to data that can be crunched with a personal computer we could bring that model to scale shah says mit to impact

automatic bug repairshare june larry hardesty mit news office system fixes bugs by importing functionality from other programs without access to source code illustration jose luis olivares mit at the association for computing machinery s programming language design and implementation conference this month mit researchers presented a new system that repairs dangerous software bugs by automatically importing functionality from other more secure applications remarkably the system dubbed codephage doesn t require access to the source code of the applications whose functionality it s borrowing instead it analyzes the applications execution and characterizes the types of security checks they perform as a consequence it can import checks from applications written in programming languages other than the one in which the program it s repairing was written once it s imported code into a vulnerable application codephage can provide a further layer of analysis that guarantees that the bug has been repaired we have tons of source code available in open source repositories millions of projects and a lot of these projects implement similar specifications says stelios sidiroglou douskos a research scientist at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail who led the development of codephage even though that might not be the core functionality of the program they frequently have subcomponents that share functionality across a large number of projects with codephage he says over time what you d be doing is building this hybrid system that takes the best components from all these implementations sidiroglou douskos and his coauthors mit professor of computer science and engineering martin rinard graduate student fan long and eric lahtinen a researcher in rinard s group refer to the program codephage is repairing as the recipient and the program whose functionality it s borrowing as the donor to begin its analysis codephage requires two sample inputs one that causes the recipient to crash and one that doesn t a bug locating program that the same group reported in march dubbed diode generates crash inducing inputs automatically but a user may simply have found that trying to open a particular file caused a crash carrying the past first codephage feeds the safe input the one that doesn t induce crashes to the donor it then tracks the sequence of operations the donor executes and records them using a symbolic expression a string of symbols that describes the logical constraints the operations impose at some point for instance the donor may check to see whether the size of the input is below some threshold if it is codephage will add a term to its growing symbolic expression that represents the condition of being below that threshold it doesn t record the actual size of the file just the constraint imposed by the check next codephage feeds the donor the crash inducing input again it builds up a symbolic expression that represents the operations the donor performs when the new symbolic expression diverges from the old one however codephage interrupts the process the divergence represents a constraint that the safe input met and the crash inducing input does not as such it could be a security check missing from the recipient codephage then analyzes the recipient to find locations at which the input meets most but not quite all of the constraints described by the new symbolic expression the recipient may perform different operations in a different order than the donor does and it may store data in different forms but the symbolic expression describes the state of the data after it s been processed not the processing itself at each of the locations it identifies codephage can dispense with most of the constraints described by the symbolic expression the constraints that the recipient too imposes starting with the first location it translates the few constraints that remain into the language of the recipient and inserts them into the source code then it runs the recipient again using the crash inducing input if the program holds up the new code has solved the problem if it doesn t codephage moves on to the next candidate location in the recipient if the program is still crashing even after codephage has tried repairs at all the candidate locations it returns to the donor program and continues building up its symbolic expression until it arrives at another point of divergence automated future the researchers tested codephage on seven common open source programs in which diode had found bugs importing repairs from between two and four donors for each in all instances codephage was able to patch up the vulnerable code and it generally took between two and minutes per repair as the researchers explain in modern commercial software security checks can take up percent of the code or even more one of their hopes is that future versions of codephage could drastically reduce the time that software developers spend on grunt work by automating those checks insertion the longer term vision is that you never have to write a piece of code that somebody else has written before rinard says the system finds that piece of code and automatically puts it together with whatever pieces of code you need to make your program work the technique of borrowing code from another program that has similar functionality and being able to take a program that essentially is broken and fix it in that manner is a pretty cool result says emery berger a professor of computer science at the university of massachusetts at amherst to be honest i was surprised that it worked at all the donor program was not written by the same people berger explains they have different coding standards they name variables differently they use all kinds of different variables the variables could be local or they could be higher up in the stack and codephage is able to identify these connections and

making the new siliconshare july rob matheson mit news gallium nitride electronics could drastically cut energy usage in data centers consumer devices image shown here is a prototype laptop power adapter made by cambridge electronics using gan transistors at cubic inches in volume this is the smallest laptop power adapter ever made courtesy of cambridge electronics an exotic material called gallium nitride gan is poised to become the next semiconductor for power electronics enabling much higher efficiency than silicon in the department of energy doe dedicated approximately half of a million research institute for power electronics to gan research citing its potential to reduce worldwide energy consumption now mit spinout cambridge electronics inc cei has announced a line of gan transistors and power electronic circuits that promise to cut energy usage in data centers electric cars and consumer devices by to percent worldwide by power electronics is a ubiquitous technology used to convert electricity to higher or lower voltages and different currents such as in a laptop s power adapter or in electric substations that convert voltages and distribute electricity to consumers many of these power electronics systems rely on silicon transistors that switch on and off to regulate voltage but due to speed and resistance constraints waste energy as heat cei s gan transistors have at least one tenth the resistance of such silicon based transistors according to the company this allows for much higher energy efficiency and orders of magnitude faster switching frequency meaning power electronics systems with these components can be made much smaller cei is using its transistors to enable power electronics that will make data centers less energy intensive electric cars cheaper and more powerful and laptop power adapters one third the size or even small enough to fit inside the computer itself this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to change electronics and to really make an impact on how energy is used in the world says cei co founder tom s palacios an mit associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science who co invented the technology other co founders and co inventors are anantha chandrakasan the joseph f and nancy p keithley professor in electrical engineering now chair of cei s technical advisory board alumnus bin lu sm phd cei s vice president for device development ling xia phd cei s director of operations mohamed azize cei s director of epitaxy and omair saadat phd cei s director of product reliability making gan feasible while gan transistors have several benefits over silicon safety drawbacks and expensive manufacturing methods have largely kept them off the market but palacios lu saadat and other mit researchers managed to overcome these issues through design innovations made in the late s power transistors are designed to flow high currents when on and to block high voltages when off should the circuit break or fail the transistors must default to the off position to cut the current to avoid short circuits and other issues an important feature of silicon power transistors but gan transistors are typically normally on meaning by default they ll always allow a flow of current which has historically been difficult to correct using resources in mit s microsystems technology laboratory the researchers supported by department of defense and doe grants developed gan transistors that were normally off by modifying the structure of the material to make traditional gan transistors scientists grow a thin layer of gan on top of a substrate the mit researchers layered different materials with disparate compositions in their gan transistors finding the precise mix allowed a new kind of gan transistors that go to the off position by default we always talk about gan as gallium and nitrogen but you can modify the basic gan material add impurities and other elements to change its properties palacios says but gan and other nonsilicon semiconductors are also manufactured in special processes which are expensive to drop costs the mit researchers at the institute and later with the company developed new fabrication technologies or process recipes lu says this involved among other things switching out gold metals used in manufacturing gan devices for metals that were compatible with silicon fabrication and developing ways to deposit gan on large wafers used by silicon foundries basically we are fabricating our advanced gan transistors and circuits in conventional silicon foundries at the cost of silicon the cost is the same but the performance of the new devices is times better lu says major applications cei is currently using its advanced transistors to develop laptop power adaptors that are approximately cubic inches in volume the smallest ever made among the other feasible applications for the transistors palacios says is better power electronics for data centers run by google amazon facebook and other companies to power the cloud currently these data centers eat up about percent of electricity in the united states but gan based power electronics palacios says could save a very significant fraction of that another major future application palacios adds will be replacing the silicon based power electronics in electric cars these are in the chargers that charge the battery and the inverters that convert the battery power to drive the electric motors the silicon transistors used today have a constrained power capability that limits how much power the car can handle this is one of the main reasons why there are few large electric vehicles gan based power electronics on the other hand could boost power output for electric cars while making them more energy efficient and lighter and therefore cheaper and capable of driving longer distances electric vehicles are popular but still a niche product gan power electronics will be key to make them mainstream palacios says innovative ideas in launching cei the mit founders turned to the institute s entrepreneurial programs which contributed to the

an area that could help breathe new life into a u s manufacturing base that has been in decline in recent years the public private partnership announced today aims to spur these twin goals improving integration of photonic systems while revitalizing u s manufacturing the consortium includes universities community colleges and businesses in states six state governments including that of massachusetts are also supporting the project mit faculty will manage important parts of the program michael watts an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science will lead the technological innovation in silicon photonics lionel kimerling the thomas lord professor in materials science and engineering will lead a program in education and workforce development this is great news on a number of fronts mit provost martin schmidt says photonics holds the key to advances in computing and its pursuit will engage and energize research and economic activity from rochester new york to cambridge massachusetts and beyond mit faculty are excited to contribute to this effort an ongoing partnership mit s existing collaboration with suny poly led to the first complete millimeter silicon photonics platform watts says that effort has led to numerous subsequent advances in silicon photonics technology with mit developing photonic designs that suny poly has then built in its state of the art fabrication facility photonic devices are seen as key to continuing the advances in computing speed and efficiency described by moore s law which may have reached their theoretical limits in existing silicon based electronics kimerling says the integration of photonics with electronics promises not only to boost the performance of systems in data centers and high performance computing but also to reduce their energy consumption which already accounts for more than percent of all electricity use in the u s kimerling points out that a single new high performance computer installation can contain more than million photonic connections between hundreds of thousands of computer processor units cpus that s more than the entire telecommunications industry he says so creating new inexpensive and energy efficient connection systems at scale is a major need the integration of such systems has been progressing in stages kimerling says initially the conversion from optical to electronic signals became pervasive at the network level to support long distance telecommunication but it is now moving to circuit boards and will ultimately go to the level of individual integrated circuit chips europe is ahead in industry coordination right now following a decade of government investment kimerling says this new u s initiative he says is one of the first of this kind in the u s and the bet is that the innovation and research here combined with the manufacturing capability will allow our companies to really take off leadership in technological innovation within the new alliance mit will lead technological innovation in silicon photonics that task will be managed by watts the evolving integration of photonics and electronics will have a great impact on many different technologies watts says for example lidar systems similar to radar but using light beams instead of radio waves have great potential for collision avoidance systems in cars since they can provide greater detail than radar or sonar watts has worked to develop single chip lidar devices which could eliminate the moving parts in existing devices such as tiny gimbaled mirrors used to direct the light beams in a scanning pattern replacing them with fixed electrically steerable phased array systems like those now used for cellphone tower antennas lidar systems that exist today are both bulky and expensive because they use mechanically scanned lasers watts says but doing the same thing at the nanoscale using phased array systems on a chip could drastically reduce size and cost providing high resolution chip scale d imaging capabilities that do not exist today he says there are many other areas where integration of photonics and electronics could lead to big advances including in biological and chemical sensors that could have greater sensitivity than existing electronic versions and in new kinds of medical imaging systems such as optical coherent tomography the goal of this initiative is to lower the barriers to entry in this field for u s companies watts says it is intended to function much like a major public private initiative that helped pave the way decades ago for the development of electronic chip manufacturing in the u s significant photonic chip manufacturing capabilities have been developed at suny poly in albany new york that facility has already made the world s largest silicon based photonic circuit a chip designed at mit and built using industry standard millimeter wide silicon wafers watts says

toward tiny solar powered sensorsshare june larry hardesty mit news office new ultralow power circuit improves efficiency of energy harvesting to more than percent image the mit researchers prototype for a chip measuring millimeters by millimeters the magnified detail shows the chip s main control circuitry including the startup electronics the controller that determines whether to charge the battery power a device or both and the array of switches that control current flow to an external inductor coil this active area measures just millimeters by millimeters courtesy of the researchers the latest buzz in the information technology industry regards the internet of things the idea that vehicles appliances civil engineering structures manufacturing equipment and even livestock would have their own embedded sensors that report information directly to networked servers aiding with maintenance and the coordination of tasks realizing that vision however will require extremely low power sensors that can run for months without battery changes or even better that can extract energy from the environment to recharge last week at the symposia on vlsi technology and circuits mit researchers presented a new power converter chip that can harvest more than percent of the energy trickling into it even at the extremely low power levels characteristic of tiny solar cells previous ultralow power converters that used the same approach had efficiencies of only or percent moreover the researchers chip achieves those efficiency improvements while assuming additional responsibilities where most of its ultralow power predecessors could use a solar cell to either charge a battery or directly power a device this new chip can do both and it can power the device directly from the battery all of those operations also share a single inductor the chip s main electrical component which saves on circuit board space but increases the circuit complexity even further nonetheless the chip s power consumption remains low we still want to have battery charging capability and we still want to provide a regulated output voltage says dina reda el damak an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the new paper we need to regulate the input to extract the maximum power and we really want to do all these tasks with inductor sharing and see which operational mode is the best and we want to do it without compromising the performance at very limited input power levels nanowatts to microwatt for the internet of things the prototype chip was manufactured through the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company s university shuttle program ups and downs the circuit s chief function is to regulate the voltages between the solar cell the battery and the device the cell is powering if the battery operates for too long at a voltage that s either too high or too low for instance its chemical reactants break down and it loses the ability to hold a charge to control the current flow across their chip el damak and her advisor anantha chandrakasan the joseph f and nancy p keithley professor in electrical engineering use an inductor which is a wire wound into a coil when a current passes through an inductor it generates a magnetic field which in turn resists any change in the current throwing switches in the inductor s path causes it to alternately charge and discharge so that the current flowing through it continuously ramps up and then drops back down to zero keeping a lid on the current improves the circuit s efficiency since the rate at which it dissipates energy as heat is proportional to the square of the current once the current drops to zero however the switches in the inductor s path need to be thrown immediately otherwise current could begin to flow through the circuit in the wrong direction which would drastically diminish its efficiency the complication is that the rate at which the current rises and falls depends on the voltage generated by the solar cell which is highly variable so the timing of the switch throws has to vary too electric hourglass to control the switches timing el damak and chandrakasan use an electrical component called a capacitor which can store electrical charge the higher the current the more rapidly the capacitor fills when it s full the circuit stops charging the inductor the rate at which the current drops off however depends on the output voltage whose regulation is the very purpose of the chip since that voltage is fixed the variation in timing has to come from variation in capacitance el damak and chandrakasan thus equip their chip with a bank of capacitors of different sizes as the current drops it charges a subset of those capacitors whose selection is determined by the solar cell s voltage once again when the capacitor fills the switches in the inductor s path are flipped in this technology space there s usually a trend to lower efficiency as the power gets lower because there s a fixed amount of energy that s consumed by doing the work says brett miwa who leads a power conversion development project as a fellow at the chip manufacturer maxim integrated if you re only coming in with a small amount it s hard to get most of it out because you lose more as a percentage el damak s design is unusually efficient for how low a power level she s at one of the things that s most notable about it is that it s really a fairly complete system he adds it s really kind of a full system on a chip for power management and that makes it a little more complicated a little bit larger and a little bit more comprehensive than some of the other designs that might be reported in the literature so for her to still achieve these high performance specs

graphene layer to improve power plant efficiency work of kong and wangshare may jing kong professor of electrical engineering in the eecs department at mit and principal investigator with the microsystems technology laboratories and the research lab of electronics has worked with mit students and evelyn wang professor in mit s mechanical engineering department to create a graphene coating for power plant condensers a step that will improve power plant efficiency to percent and ultimately making a significant dent in global carbon emissions image an uncoated copper condenser tube top left is shown next to a similar tube coated with graphene top right when exposed to water vapor at degrees celsius the uncoated tube produces an inefficient water film bottom left while the coated shows the more desirable dropwise condensation bottom right courtesy of the researchers and mit news read more in the may mit news office article by david l chandler titled thin coating on condensers could make power plants more efficient graphene layer one atom thick could quadruple rate of condensation heat transfer in generating plants also posted below most of the world s electricity producing power plants whether powered by coal natural gas or nuclear fission make electricity by generating steam that turns a turbine that steam then is condensed back to water and the cycle begins again but the condensers that collect the steam are quite inefficient and improving them could make a big difference in overall power plant efficiency now a team of researchers at mit has developed a way of coating these condenser surfaces with a layer of graphene just one atom thick and found that this can improve the rate of heat transfer by a factor of four and potentially even more than that with further work and unlike polymer coatings the graphene coatings have proven to be highly durable in laboratory tests the findings are reported in the journal nano letters by mit graduate student daniel preston professors evelyn wang and jing kong and two others the improvement in condenser heat transfer which is just one step in the power production cycle could lead to an overall improvement in power plant efficiency of to percent based on figures from the electric power research institute preston says enough to make a significant dent in global carbon emissions since such plants represent the vast majority of the world s electricity generation that translates into millions of dollars per power plant per year he explains there are two basic ways in which the condensers which may take the form of coiled metal tubes often made of copper interact with the flow of steam in some cases the steam condenses to form a thin sheet of water that coats the surface in others it forms water droplets that are pulled from the surface by gravity when the steam forms a film preston explains that impedes heat transfer and thus reduces the efficiency of condensation so the goal of much research has been to enhance droplet formation on these surfaces by making them water repelling often this has been accomplished using polymer coatings but these tend to degrade rapidly in the high heat and humidity of a power plant and when the coatings are made thicker to reduce that degradation the coatings themselves impede heat transfer we thought graphene could be useful preston says since we know it is hydrophobic by nature so he and his colleagues decided to test both graphene s ability to shed water and its durability under typical power plant conditions an environment of pure water vapor at degrees celsius they found that the single atom thick coating of graphene did indeed improve heat transfer fourfold compared with surfaces where the condensate forms sheets of water such as bare metals further calculations showed that optimizing temperature differences could boost this improvement to to times the researchers also showed that after two full weeks under such conditions there was no measurable degradation in the graphene s performance by comparison similar tests using a common water repelling coating showed that the coating began to degrade within just three hours preston says and failed completely within hours because the process used to coat the graphene on the copper surface called chemical vapor deposition has been tested extensively the new method could be ready for testing under real world conditions in as little as a year preston says and the process should be easily scalable to power plant sized condenser coils this work is extremely significant because to my knowledge it is the first report of durable dropwise condensation with a single layer surface coating says jonathan boreyko an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and mechanics at virginia tech who has studied condensation on superhydrophobic surface these findings are somewhat surprising and very exciting boreyko who was not involved in the research adds that this method if proven through further testing could significantly improve the efficiency of power plants and other systems that utilize condensers the research team also included mit postdoc daniela mafra and former postdoc nenad miljkovic who is now an assistant professor at the university of illinois at urbana champaign the work was supported by the office of naval research and the national science foundation

associates but is used collaboratively by over individuals every student participates as a team member in the operation of the lab he says one key motivation for bulovi s work is increasing energy efficiency today more than percent of the world s electricity is used on tvs and display monitors we think we can reduce that by a factor of two which would be a significant energy impact even more today percent of electricity is used on powering light bulbs we think we can reduce that number by a factor of two as well increasing energy efficiency is one key driver of our research bulovi explains principles and applications all of the pursuits start with the understanding of the basic physical principles which are then applied to the operation of practical devices says bulovi the group combines expertise in electricity and magnetism and knowledge of quantum mechanics together with uses of nanomaterials to make devices as diverse as solar cells leds lasers chemosensors and mechanical actuators we use our devices as test beds of physics and try to ascertain what physical mechanisms dominate the nanoscale proceses within them if the devices do not perform as well as we

production of large screen and flexible oled displays also posted below flexible smartphones and color saturated television displays were some highlights at this year s consumer electronics showcase held in january in las vegas many of those displays were made using organic light emitting diodes or oleds semiconducting films about nanometers thick made of organic compounds and sandwiched between two electrodes that emit light in response to electricity this allows each individual pixel of an oled screen to emit red green and blue without a backlight to produce more saturated color and use less energy the film can also be coated onto flexible plastic substrates but there s a reason why these darlings of the showroom are not readily available on shelves they re not very cost effective to

flex was engineered to enable thin film encapsulation tfe tfe is the process that gives thinness and flexibility to oled devices kateeva hopes flexible displays produced by yieldjet flex will hit the shelves by the end of the year the second tool which will debut later this year aims to cut costs and defects associated with patterning oled materials onto substrates in order to make producing inch screens easier by boosting yields as well as speeding up production reducing materials and reducing maintenance time the system aims to cut manufacturing costs by about percent says kateeva co founder

jianglong chen sm phd now program director and valerie leblanc phd now staff scientist getting flexible tfe was invented to coat flexible oled screens with a barrier as solid as glass but bendable but it is prone to contamination and other issues traditional tfe processing methods enclose the substrate in a vacuum chamber where a vapor of the encapsulating film is sprayed onto the substrate through a metal stencil this process is slow and expensive primarily because of wasted material and requires stopping the machine frequently for cleaning there are also issues with defects as the coating that hits the chamber walls and stencil can potentially flake off and fall onto the substrate in between adding layers but moisture and even some air particles can sneak into the chamber which is deadly to oleds when electricity hits oleds contaminated with water and air particles the resulting chemical reactions reduce the oleds quality and lifespan any displays contaminated during manufacturing are discarded and to make up for lost yield companies boost retail prices only two companies now sell oled television displays with inch models selling for to about to more than their inch lcd and led counterparts yieldjet flex aims to solve many tfe issues a key innovation is encasing the printer in a nitrogen chamber cutting exposure to oxygen and moisture as well as cutting contamination with particles notorious for diminishing oled yields by times over current methods that use vacuum chambers low particle nitrogen is the best low cost inert environment you can use for oled manufacturing madigan says in its tfe process the yieldjet precisely coats organic films over the display area as part of the tfe structure the organic layer flattens and smoothes the surface to provide ideal conditions for depositing the subsequent layers in the tfe structure depositing onto a smooth clean surface dramatically improves the quality of the tfe structure enabling high yields and reliability

qubits that can transfer photons extending the superposition time of these qubits a hundredfold ultimately leading toward practical quantum computing their work has been published in nature

center courtesy of the researchers read more in the january mit news office article by larry hardesty titled qubits with staying power technique greatly extends duration of fragile quantum states pointing toward practical quantum computers also posted below quantum computers are experimental devices that promise exponential speedups on some computational problems where a bit in a classical computer can represent either a or a a quantum bit or qubit can represent and simultaneously letting quantum computers explore multiple problem solutions in parallel but such superpositions of quantum states are in practice difficult to maintain in a paper appearing this week in nature communications mit researchers and colleagues at brookhaven national laboratory and the synthetic diamond company element six describe a new design that in experiments extended the superposition time of a promising type of qubit a hundredfold in the long term the work could lead toward practical quantum computers but in the shorter term it could enable the indefinite extension of quantum secured communication links a commercial application of quantum information technology that currently has a range of less than miles the researchers qubit design employs nitrogen atoms embedded in synthetic diamond when nitrogen atoms happen to be situated next to gaps in the diamond s crystal lattice they produce nitrogen vacancies which enable researchers to optically control the magnetic orientation or spin of individual electrons and atomic nuclei spin can be up down or a superposition of the two to date the most successful demonstrations of quantum computing have involved atoms trapped in magnetic fields but holding an atom in vacuum is difficult so there s been a big effort to try to trap them in solids says dirk englund the jamieson career development assistant professor in electrical engineering and computer science at mit and corresponding author on the new paper in particular you want a transparent solid so you can send light in and out crystals are better than many other solids like glass in that their atoms are nice and regular and their electronic structure is well defined and amongst all the crystals diamond is a particularly good host for capturing an atom because it turns out that the nuclei of diamond are mostly free of magnetic dipoles which can cause noise on the electron spin light conversation in bulk diamond superpositions of the spins in nitrogen vacancies can last almost a second but in order to communicate with each other nitrogen vacancy qubits need to be able to transfer information via particles of light or photons this requires positioning the vacancy inside an optical resonator which temporarily traps photons previously devices consisting of nitrogen vacancies inside optical resonators exhibited a superposition time of only around a microsecond the researchers new design gets that up to microseconds for quantum computing applications however it s not enough to keep individual qubits in superposition their quantum states also need to be entangled so that if one qubit falls out of superposition if it takes on a definite value of either or it constrains the possible states of the other qubits in systems that use light to move information between nitrogen vacancy qubits entanglement occurs when light particles emitted by the qubits reach an optical component such as a beam splitter at the same time with the earlier systems it generally took several minutes to produce entanglement between qubits with the new system it should take milliseconds that s still too long a practical device would need to entangle photons before their corresponding qubits fell out of superposition or decohered but the numbers actually look quite promising englund says in the coming years the entanglement rate could be orders of magnitude faster than the decoherence the researchers device consists of a ladderlike diamond structure with a nitrogen vacancy at its center which is suspended horizontally above a silicon substrate shining light perpendicularly onto the ladder kicks the electron in the nitrogen vacancy into a higher energy state when it drops back down to its ground state it releases that excess energy as a photon whose quantum states can be correlated with its own the gaps in the diamond structure the spaces between rungs in the ladder act as what s called a photonic crystal confining the photon so that it bounces back and forth across the vacancy thousands of times when the photon finally emerges it has a high likelihood of traveling along the axis of the ladder so that it can be guided into an optical fiber the right direction practically the only way to synchronize the photons emitted by different qubits is probabilistically repeat the experiment enough and eventually the photons will arrive at the optical component at the same time in previous systems both the time and the direction of the photons emission were left to chance in the new system the timing is still erratic but direction is much more reliable that together with the greater purity of the emitted light should reduce the time required to produce entanglement the researchers manufacturing process begins with a micrometer thick wafer of synthetic diamond with nitrogen atoms embedded in it at regular intervals which is made

electronics made from the rare earth elements compounds that are vital to many manufacturing processes and products thanks to their unusual material properties the unique aspects of compounds containing these elements have already opened the doors to significant technological impact in permanent magnet lighting and battery technologies checkelsky says yet checkelsky pointed out in his grant proposal in the field of electronics itself they have been less impactful part of the reason for that is how challenging rare earths are to work with the large number of interacting electrons in

the rare earths by constructing a device to create and study them measuring the materials properties while keeping them from ever touching air the bose award is allowing us to work with systems often

quantum mechanics tiny physical particles are counterintuitively able to inhabit mutually exclusive states at the same time a computational element made from such a particle known as a quantum bit or qubit could thus represent zero and one simultaneously if multiple qubits are entangled meaning that their quantum states depend on each other then a single quantum computation is in some sense like performing many computations in parallel with most particles entanglement is difficult to maintain but it s relatively easy with photons for that reason optical systems are a promising approach to quantum computation but any quantum computer say one whose qubits are laser trapped ions or nitrogen atoms embedded in diamond would still benefit from using entangled photons to move quantum information around because ultimately one will want to make such optical processors with maybe tens or hundreds of photonic qubits it becomes unwieldy to do this using traditional optical components says dirk englund the jamieson career development assistant professor in electrical engineering and computer science at mit and corresponding author on the new paper it s not only unwieldy but probably impossible because if you tried to build it on a large optical table simply the random motion of the table would cause noise on these optical states so there s been an effort to miniaturize these optical circuits onto photonic integrated circuits the project was a collaboration between englund s group and the quantum nanostructures and nanofabrication group which is led by karl berggren an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and of which najafi is a member the mit researchers were also joined by colleagues at ibm and nasa s jet propulsion laboratory relocation the researchers process begins with a silicon optical chip made using conventional manufacturing techniques on a separate silicon chip they grow a thin flexible film of silicon nitride upon which they deposit the superconductor niobium nitride in a pattern useful for photon detection at both ends of the resulting detector they deposit gold electrodes then to one end of the silicon nitride film they attach a small droplet of polydimethylsiloxane a type of silicone they then press a tungsten probe typically used to measure voltages in experimental chips against the silicone it s almost like silly putty englund says you put it down it spreads out and makes high surface contact area and when you pick it up quickly it will maintain that large surface area and then it relaxes back so that it comes back to one point it s like if you try to pick up a coin with your finger you press on it and pick it up quickly and shortly after it will fall off with the tungsten probe the researchers peel the film off its substrate and attach it to the optical chip in previous arrays the detectors registered only percent of the single photons directed at them even on chip detectors deposited individually have historically topped out at about percent but the detectors on the researchers new chip got as high as percent that s still a long way from the percent or more required for a practical quantum circuit but it s a big step in the right direction this work is a technical tour de force says robert hadfield a professor of photonics at the university of glasgow who was not involved in the research there is potential for scale up to large circuits requiring hundreds of detectors using commercial pick and place technology mit electrical engineering computer science room

crash tolerant data storageshare august larry hardesty mit news formally verified working file system could lead to computers guaranteed never to lose your data illustration christine daniloff mit in a computer operating system the file system is the part that writes data to disk and tracks where the data is stored if the computer crashes while it s writing data the file system s records can become corrupt hours of work could be lost or programs could stop working properly at the acm symposium on operating systems principles in october mit researchers will present the first file system that is mathematically guaranteed not to lose track of data during crashes although the file system is slow by today s standards the techniques the researchers used to verify its performance can be extended to more sophisticated designs ultimately formal verification could make it much easier to develop reliable efficient file systems what many people worry about is building these file systems to be reliable both when they re operating normally but also in the case of crashes power failure software bugs hardware errors what have you says nickolai zeldovich an associate professor of computer science and engineering and one of three mit computer science professors on the new paper making sure that the file system can recover from a crash at any point is tricky because there are so many different places that you could crash you literally have to consider every instruction or every disk operation and think well what if i crash now what now what now and so empirically people have found lots of bugs in file systems that have to do with crash recovery and they keep finding them even in very well tested file systems because it s just so hard to do proving ground zeldovich and his colleagues frans kaashoek the charles a piper professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs associate professor of computer science adam chlipala haogang chen a graduate student in eecs and daniel ziegler an undergraduate in eecs established the reliability of their file system through a process known as formal verification formal verification involves mathematically describing the acceptable bounds of operation for a computer program and then proving that the program will never exceed them it s a complicated process so it s generally applied only to very high level schematic representations of a program s functionality translating those high level schema into working code however can introduce myriad complications that the proofs don t address all these paper proofs about other file systems may actually be correct but there s no file system that we can be sure represents what the proof is about ziegler says what distinguishes the mit researchers work is that they prove properties of the file system s final code not a high level schema to do that they took advantage of a tool known as a proof assistant which provides a formal language for describing aspects of a computer system and the relationships between them this formal proving environment includes a programming language chlipala explains so we implement the file system in the same language where we re writing the proofs and the proofs are checked against the actual file system not some whiteboard idealization that has no formal connection to the code the proof assistant known as coq provided the tools but the mit researchers still had to do the work first they had to describe the components of a file system using coq s formal language you have to define what is a disk zeldovich says and what is a bit chlipala adds next they had to formally describe the relationships between the behaviors of these different components under crash conditions only then could they begin to construct a proof that a file system would behave the way it should finally they had to write the corresponding file system the part of the process that coq automated was determining that the file system did in fact adhere to the logical relationships described in the proof reproducibility in the course of writing the file system they repeatedly went back and retooled the system specifications and vice versa but even though they rewrote the file system probably times zeldovich says kaashoek estimates that they spent percent of their time on the definitions of the system components and the relationships between them and on the proof we ve written file systems many times over so we know exactly what it s going to look like zeldovich says whereas with all these logics and proofs there are so many ways to write them down and each one of them has subtle implications down the line that we didn t really understand no one had done it kaashoek adds it s not like you could look up a paper that says this is the way to do it but now you can read our paper and presumably do it a lot faster it s not like people haven t proven things in the past says ulfar erlingsson lead manager for security research at google who has observed the new work from a distance but usually the methods and technologies the formalisms that were developed for creating the proofs were so esoteric and so specific to the problem that there was basically hardly any chance that there would be repeat work that built up on it but i can say for certain that adam s stuff with coq and separation logic this is stuff that s going to get built on and applied in many different domains that s what s so exciting read this article on mit news mit electrical engineering computer

cutting cost and power consumption for big datashare july larry hardesty mit news new network design exploits cheap power efficient flash memory without sacrificing speed image istock random access memory or ram is where computers like to store the data they re working on a processor can retrieve data from ram tens of thousands of times more rapidly than it can from the computer s disk drive but in the age of big data data sets are often much too large to fit in a single computer s ram the data describing a single human genome would take up the ram of somewhere between and typical computers flash memory the type of memory used by most portable devices could provide an alternative to conventional ram for big data applications it s about a tenth as expensive and it consumes about a tenth as much power the problem is that it s also a tenth as fast but at the international symposium on computer architecture in june mit researchers presented a new system that for several common big data applications should make servers using flash memory as efficient as those using conventional ram while preserving their power and cost savings the researchers also presented experimental evidence showing that if the servers executing a distributed computation have to go to disk for data even percent of the time their performance falls to a level that s comparable with flash anyway in other words even without the researchers new techniques for accelerating data retrieval from flash memory servers with terabytes worth of ram couldn t handle a terabyte computation any better than servers with terabytes worth of flash memory which would consume only a fraction as much power this is not a replacement for dram dynamic ram or anything like that says arvind the johnson professor of computer science and engineering at mit whose group performed the new work but there may be many applications that can take advantage of this new style of architecture which companies recognize everybody s experimenting with different aspects of flash we re just trying to establish another point in the design space joining arvind on the new paper are sang woo jun and ming liu mit graduate students in computer science and engineering and joint first authors their fellow grad student shuotao xu sungjin lee a postdoc in arvind s group myron king and jamey hicks who did their phds with arvind and were researchers at quanta computer when the new system was developed and one of their colleagues from quanta john ankcorn who is also an mit alumnus outsourced computation the researchers were able to make a network of flash based servers competitive with a network of ram based servers by moving a little computational power off of the servers and onto the chips that control the flash drives by preprocessing some of the data on the flash drives before passing it back to the servers those chips can make distributed computation much more efficient and since the preprocessing algorithms are wired into the chips they dispense with the computational overhead associated with running an operating system maintaining a file system and the like with hardware contributed by some of their sponsors quanta samsung and xilinx the researchers built a prototype network of servers each server was connected to a field programmable gate array or fpga a kind of chip that can be reprogrammed to mimic different types of electrical circuits each fpga in turn was connected to two half terabyte or gigabyte flash chips and to the two fpgas nearest it in the server rack because the fpgas were connected to each other they created a very fast network that allowed any server to retrieve data from any flash drive they also controlled the flash drives which is no simple task the controllers that come with modern commercial flash drives have as many as eight different processors and a gigabyte of working memory finally the fpgas also executed the algorithms that preprocessed the data stored on the flash drives the researchers tested three such algorithms geared to three popular big data applications one is image search or trying to find matches for a sample image in a huge database another is an implementation of google s pagerank algorithm which assesses the importance of different web pages that meet the same search criteria and the third is an application called memcached which big database driven websites use to store frequently accessed information chameleon clusters fpgas are about one tenth as fast as purpose built chips with hardwired circuits but they re much faster than central processing units using software to perform the same computations ordinarily either they re used to prototype new designs or they re used in niche products whose sales volumes are too small to warrant the high cost of manufacturing purpose built chips but the mit and quanta researchers design suggests a new use for fpgas a host of applications could benefit from accelerators like the three the researchers designed and since fpgas are reprogrammable they could be loaded with different accelerators depending on the application that could lead to distributed processing systems that lose little versatility while providing major savings in energy and cost many big data applications require real time or fast responses says jihong kim a professor of computer science and engineering at seoul national university for such applications bluedbm the mit and quanta researchers system is an appealing solution relative to some other proposals for streamlining big data analysis the main advantage of bluedbm might be that it can easily scale up to a lot bigger storage system with specialized accelerated supports kim says read this article on mit news mit

csail report giving government special access to data poses major security risksshare july adam conner simons csail whether backdoor or front door government access imperils your data report authors say illustration istock in recent months government officials in the united states the united kingdom and other countries have made repeated calls for law enforcement agencies to be able to access upon due authorization encrypted data to help them solve crimes beyond the ethical and political implications of such an approach though is a more practical question if we want to maintain the security of user information is this sort of access even technically possible that was the impetus for a report titled keys under doormats mandating insecurity by requiring government access to all data and communications published today by security experts from mit s computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail alongside other leading researchers from the u s and the u k the report argues that such mechanisms pose far more grave security risks imperil innovation on which the world s economies depend and raise more thorny policy issues than we could have imagined when the internet was in its infancy the team warns that rushing to create a legislative proposal is dangerous until security specialists are able to evaluate a comprehensive technical solution that has been carefully analyzed for vulnerabilities csail contributors to the report include professors hal abelson and ron rivest phd student michael specter information services and technology network manager jeff schiller and principal research scientist daniel weitzner who spearheaded the work as director of mit s cybersecurity and internet policy research initiative an interdisciplinary program funded by a million grant from the hewlett foundation the group also includes cryptography expert bruce schneier and researchers from stanford university columbia university cambridge university johns hopkins university microsoft research sri international and worcester polytechnic institute not so exceptional access in october fbi director james comey called for what is often described as exceptional access namely that computer systems should be able to provide access to the plaintext of encrypted information in transit or stored on a device at the request of authorized law enforcement agencies the research team outlines three reasons why this approach would worsen the already shaky current state of cybersecurity first it would require preserving private keys that could be compromised not only by law enforcement but by anyone who is able to hack into them this represents a degree reversal from state of the art security practices like forward secrecy in which decryption keys are deleted immediately after use it would be the equivalent of taking already read highly sensitive messages and rather than putting them through a shredder leaving them in the file cabinet of an unlocked office weitzner says keeping keys around makes them more susceptible to compromise second exceptional access would make systems much more complex introducing new features that require independent testing and are sources of potential vulnerabilities given that the new mechanisms may have to be used in secret by law enforcement it would also be difficult and perhaps illegal for programmers to even test how these features operate weitzner says third special access in complex systems like smartphones would create vulnerable single points of failure that would be particularly attractive targets for hackers cybercrime groups and other countries any attacker who could break into the system that stores the security credentials would instantly gain access to all of the data thereby putting potentially millions of users at risk earlier this spring the head of the national security agency pushed back against assertions that the u s government was advocating for a backdoor instead suggesting a front door method of unlocking a device using a digital key that is divided into multiple pieces but researchers argue in the report that such methods make an attacker s job harder but not impossible and require that mechanisms be decidedly more complex to implement weitzner says that while he recognizes the desire to be able to recover relevant information to solve crimes he views government eagerness for access as a perilous example of putting the cart before the horse at a time when we are struggling to make the internet more secure these proposals would take a step backward by building weakness into our infrastructure weitzner says it s like leaving your house keys under the doormat sure it may be convenient but it creates the opportunity for anyone to

read more in the april mit news office article by csail s adam conner simons titled one way to reduce email stress re invent the mailing list new csail system lets users customize the mailing list experience by following and blocking users and upvoting messages also posted below we all feel it that panicked sensation when we check our inbox and see the deluge of emails awaiting our attention the average person receives upwards of emails a day and it often seems like no amount of tagging or filtering can close the floodgates one major source of stress is the never ending conversation threads made possible by group emails mailing lists can be a fantastic medium for substantive discussions but often they deliver too much of what we don t want and not enough of what we do believe it or not such tools have barely changed since the pre internet days of arpanet years ago you either opt in or opt out you get dozens of irrelevant emails and the views of a few loudmouths usually end up drowning out the rest but what if there were a better way in an age of facebook and reddit users expect a sense of control over how they consume their content and yet that control and personalization often doesn t extend to their own inboxes now researchers from mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail are trying to change that with a new prototype system called murmur that aims to improve the mailing list experience by incorporating popular social media features like upvoting following and blocking csail phd student amy zhang lead author on a new paper she presented this week at the acm conference on human factors in computing systems in seoul says she d always been struck by the fact that people use mailing lists for such a variety of reasons a sentiment that was echoed by her team s surveys of more than individuals from different academic social and geographical mailing lists email occupies a strange space between work and play where it s inherently more professional than something like twitter but will still include content that s not directly work related says zhang who wrote the paper with mit professor david karger and university of michigan professor mark ackerman even if you set guidelines for a mailing list it can be difficult to get everyone on the same page which leads to some users feeling inbox overload and others wishing there was more substantive discussion the answer zhang says is to create an experience that s as customizable as the ones we have on social media for example a sizable portion of respondents said they wanted to have more meaningful conversations on list relevant topics but were deterred from initiating because of the perception that they were spamming people with murmur which is still in active development tentative senders will be able to post a message to a specific subset of friends on the list who could give it the equivalent of a facebook like or a reddit upvote such that it automatically spreads to more list recipients you can also explicitly exclude certain people from emails you send which could come in handy for office surprise parties or happy hours such functions emphasize what karger describes as one of the core goals of the project to make mailing lists and email more generally a better experience for people who want to have more substantial discussions mailing lists have their roots in some of the world s earliest conversations about key topics like programming and technology says karger citing newsgroup platforms like usenet they remain an integral avenue for communications and so i think it s important that we make the necessary tweaks to keep them vital and relevant as far as receiving messages many respondents expressed a feeling of interruption fatigue and wished they could choose how much content they receive murmur addresses this by letting you follow or mute particular users threads and topics and even providing the option of specifying how many emails with certain tags that you receive in a given day or week it s interesting to revisit the idea of mailing lists and what is it about this antique tool that people can t give up says gloria mark professor of informatics at the university of california at irvine what s great about the team s system is that it s still preserving the qualities of email that people find attractive but also borrowing the features from social media that make it so successful our emails have long been a topic of concern for providers google s new inbox for example tries to help by using machine learning techniques to bundle our messages into important and unimportant folders but karger objects to what he describes as paternalistic approaches to organizing our emails google has all these mysterious classifiers that create a pretty opaque experience for users in terms of how our emails are categorized says karger i like the idea of putting the human in direct control and having the computer serve more as an assistant the earliest listservs based on the first email program sndmsg were geared toward particular interests such as programming and

devadas and team design scheme and implement chip fabrication to thwart memory access attacks in the cloudshare april srini devadas the edwin sibley webster professor in mit s electrical engineering and computer science department and members of his group the computation structures group have designed a process for thwarting memory access attacks to steal data their scheme includes custom built reconfigurable chips now moving into fabrication image a new memory access protocol assigns every memory address to a single path green through a data structure known as a tree but a given node of the tree will often lie along multiple paths blue illustration christine daniloff mit read more in the april mit news office article by larry hardesty titled cloud security reaches silicon system for defending against memory access attacks implemented in chips also posted below in the last years computer security researchers have shown that malicious hackers don t need to see your data in order to steal your data from the pattern in which your computer accesses its memory banks adversaries can infer a shocking amount about what s stored there the risk of such attacks is particularly acute in the cloud where you have no control over whose applications are sharing server space with yours an antagonist could load up multiple cloud servers with small programs that do nothing but spy on other people s data two years ago researchers in the group of mit s srini devadas the edwin sibley webster professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science proposed a method for thwarting these types of attacks by disguising memory access patterns now they ve begun to implement it in hardware in march at the architectural support for programming languages and operating systems conference they presented the layout of a custom built chip that would use their scheme which is now moving into fabrication and at the ieee international symposium on field programmable custom computing machines in may they will describe some additional improvements to the scheme which they ve tested on reconfigurable chips the principle behind the scheme is that whenever a chip needs to fetch data from a particular memory address it should query a bunch of other addresses too so that an adversary can t determine which one it s really interested in naturally this requires shipping much more data between the chip and memory than would otherwise be necessary to minimize the amount of extra data needed the researchers store memory addresses in a data structure known as a tree a family tree is a familiar example of a tree in which each node a person s name is attached to only one node above it the node representing the person s parents but may connect to several nodes below it the person s children every address is randomly assigned to a path through the tree a sequence of nodes stretching from the top of the tree to the bottom with no backtracking when the chip requires the data stored at a particular address it also requests data from all the other nodes on the same path in earlier work researchers in devadas group were able to prove that pulling data from a single path was as confounding to an adversary as if the chip had pulled data from every single memory address in use every node of the tree breaking the logjam after reading data from a path however the chip also has to write data to the whole path otherwise an adversary could determine which node was the one of interest but the chip rarely stores data in the same node that it read it from nodes often lie on multiple paths to take the most basic example the single node at the top or root of the tree lies on every path when the chip writes a block of data to memory it pushes it as far down the tree as it can which means finding the last vacancy before the block s assigned path branches off from path that was just read the root of the tree is a lot smaller than the bottom of tree says albert kwon an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and one of the papers co authors so intuitively you want to push down as far as you can toward the bottom so that there s no congestion at the top in writing data the chip still has to follow the sequence of nodes in the path otherwise again an adversary might be able to infer something about the data being stored in previous attempts at similar systems that meant sorting the memory addresses according to their ultimate locations in the tree sort is not easy to do in hardware says chris fletcher another graduate student in devadas group and first author on the new paper so by the time you ve sorted everything you ve taken a real performance hit in the chip described in their latest paper fletcher devadas kwon and their co authors ling ren also an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and colleagues at the university of connecticut the university of california at berkeley and the qatar computing research institute took a different approach they gave their chip an extra memory circuit with storage slots that can be mapped onto the sequence of nodes in any path through the tree once a data block s final location is determined it s simply stored at the corresponding slot in the circuit all of the blocks are then read out in order stockpiled secrets the new chip features another trick to improve efficiency rather than writing data out every time it reads data in it writes only on every fifth read on the other reads it simply discards all

that determine whether a given program yields the right outputs to a series of inputs but those tests say nothing about whether the program code is clear or confusing whether it includes unnecessary computation and whether it meets the terms of the assignment professors and teaching assistants review students code to try to flag obvious mistakes but even in undergraduate lecture courses they usually don t have time for exhaustive analysis and that problem is much worse in online courses with thousands of students each of whom might have approached a problem in a slightly different way in april at the association for computing machinery s conference on human factors in computing systems mit researchers will present a new system that automatically compares students solutions to programming assignments lumping together those that use the same techniques for each approach the system called overcode creates a program template using variable names that a preponderance of students happen to have converged on it then displays templates side by side graying out the code they share so the differences stand out in relief and from any template instructors can if they choose pull up a list of the student programs that accord with it instructors who notice variations across templates that make no difference in practice can also write rules establishing the equivalence of alternatives in some instances for example y x might yield a different result than x y but depending on the ways in which x and y are defined in other instances it won t when it doesn t an instructor could further winnow down the number of templates by creating the rule y x x y the system could allow instructors of online courses to provide generalized feedback that addresses a broader swath of

that stonebraker is being recognized for fundamental contributions to the concepts and practices underlying modern database systems stonebreaker is the inventor of many concepts that were crucial to making databases a reality and that are used in almost all modern database systems his work on ingres introduced the notion of query modification used for integrity constraints and views his later

more than years but then out of nowhere some marketing guys started talking about big data he says that s when i realized that i d been studying this thing for the better part of my academic life stonebraker s work over the past four decades has helped spur a multibillion dollar big data industry that he himself has participated in creating and leading nine separate companies including voltdb tamr paradigm and vertica which was bought by hewlett packard in for million mike has been a trailblazer in the field of databases by asking the essential questions about how we collect organize and access information in our lives says daniela rus director of csail and the andrew and erna viterbi professor of electrical engineering and computer science he has been both a devoted academic and a serial entrepreneur and all of us at csail are so inspired by his work and proud to have him as a colleague in his previous work at the university of california at berkeley stonebraker developed two of his most influential systems ingres and postgres which provide the foundational ideas and in many cases specific source code that spawned several contemporary database products including ibm s informix and emc s greenplum ingres was one of the first relational databases which provide a more organized way to store multiple kinds of entities and which now serve as the industry standard for business storage larry rowe a professor emeritus at berkeley who helped stonebraker commercialize the technology remembers that many of their colleagues didn t think that relational databases could evolve from academic theory to practical application there s no better way to get mike going than to tell him you can t do that rowe says one of his great abilities is to imagine something that should exist ask himself why it doesn t and then set his new research goal to be making it happen postgres meanwhile integrated ingres ideas with object oriented programming enabling users to natively map objects and their attributes into databases this new notion of object relational databases could be used to represent and manipulate complex data like computer aided design geospatial data and time series stonebraker s major projects at mit include c store a column oriented database that partitions tables by column allowing delivery of dramatic performance speedups for reading large quantities of data h store a parallel database management system that can deliver a high sustained rate of operations transactions per second and scidb which represents data as arrays and provides substantially improved performance for many modern analytics settings such as machine learning and statistical data processing notably in an era in which the term open source didn t yet exist stonebraker also released many of his systems into the public domain ensuring their widespread adoption and allowing other academics to build on his work i am delighted that professor stonebraker has been recognized

members of his research group the center for resilient software including csail research scientist stelios sidiroglou douskos have developed diode for directed integer overflow detection a system to provide an effective mechanism for finding dangerous integer overflows that affect memory allocation sites in debugging code the group will present a new algorithm for identifying integer overflow bugs at this month s association for computing machinery s acm s international conference on architecural support for programming languages and operating systems read more in the mit news office march article by larry hardesty titled better debugger system to automatically find a common type of programming bug significantly outperforms its predecessors also posted below integer overflows are one of the most common bugs in computer programs not only causing programs to crash but even worse potentially offering points of attack for malicious hackers computer scientists have devised a battery of techniques to identify them but all have drawbacks this month at the association for computing machinery s international conference on architectural support for programming languages and operating systems researchers from mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail will present a new algorithm for identifying integer overflow bugs the researchers tested the algorithm on five common open source programs in which previous analyses had found three bugs the new algorithm found all three known bugs and new ones the variables used by computer programs come in a few standard types such as floating point numbers which can contain decimals characters like the letters of this sentence or integers which are whole numbers every time the program creates a new variable it assigns it a fixed amount of space in memory if a program tries to store too large a number at a memory address reserved for an integer the operating system will simply lop off the bits that don t fit it s like a car odometer says stelios sidiroglou douskos a research scientist at csail and first author on the new paper you go over a certain number of miles you go back to zero in itself an integer overflow won t crash a program in fact many programmers use integer overflows to perform certain types of computations more efficiently but if a program tries to do something with an integer that has overflowed havoc can ensue say for instance that the integer represents the number of pixels in an image the program is processing if the program allocates memory to store the image but its estimate of the image s size is off by several orders of magnitude the program will crash charting a course any program can be represented as a flow chart or more technically a graph with boxes that represent operations connected by line segments that represent the flow of data between operations any given program input will trace a single route through the graph prior techniques for finding integer overflow bugs would start at the top of the graph and begin working through it operation by operation for even a moderately complex program however that graph is enormous exhaustive exploration of the entire thing would be prohibitively time consuming what this means is that you can find a lot of errors in the early input processing code says martin rinard an mit professor of computer science and engineering and a co author on the new paper but you haven t gotten past that part of the code before the whole thing poops out and then there are all these errors deep in the program and how do you find them rinard sidiroglou douskos and several other members of rinard s group researchers eric lahtinen and paolo piselli and graduate students fan long doekhwan kim and nathan rittenhouse take a different approach their system dubbed diode for directed integer overflow detection begins by feeding the program a single sample input as that input is processed however as it traces a path through the graph the system records each of the operations performed on it by adding new terms to what s known as a symbolic expression these symbolic expressions are complicated like crazy rinard explains they re bubbling up through the very lowest levels of the system into the program this bit integer has been built up of all these complicated bit level operations that the lower level parts of your system do to take this out of your input file and construct those integers for you so if you look at them they re pages long trigger warning when the program reaches a point at which an integer is involved in a potentially dangerous operation like a memory allocation diode records the current state of the symbolic expression the initial test input won t trigger an overflow but diode can analyze the symbolic expression to calculate an input that will the process still isn t over however well written programs frequently include input checks specifically designed to prevent problems like integer overflows and the new input unlike the initial input might fail those checks so diode seeds the program with its new input and if it fails such a check it imposes a new constraint on the symbolic expression and computes a new overflow triggering input this process continues until the system either finds an input that can pass the checks but still trigger an overflow or it concludes that triggering an overflow is impossible if diode does find a trigger value it reports it providing developers with a valuable debugging tool indeed since diode doesn t require access to a program s source code but works on its binary the executable version of the program a program s users could run it and then send

eecs students graduates team to develop satellite image analysis methods to automate iding areas for developmentshare march former and current eecs graduate students have created new methods to automate identification of potential areas for development in rural villages in both india and sub saharan africa the group won a prize last year from the mit ideas global challenge image above to test their software system for identifying houses in satellite images the first step was to manually determine the house locations in this sample satellite image of a rural village in india top the team created a map bottom where red indicates building white indicates not building and green indicates not sure which includes pixels very close to the building boundaries courtesy of the researchers read more in the march mit news office article by david chandler titled satellite imagery can aid development projects new image analysis methods can automate identification of cost effective sites for grants or microgrids also posted below projects that target aid toward villages and rural areas in the developing world often face time consuming challenges even at the most basic level of figuring out where the most appropriate sites are for pilot programs or deployment of new systems such as solar power for regions that have no access to electricity often even the sizes and locations of villages are poorly mapped so time consuming field studies are needed to locate suitable sites now a team of graduate students at mit and a social service group of data scientists have come up with a way of automating parts of that evaluation process by developing software that can identify houses and even types of houses from readily available satellite imagery potentially saving considerable time that would otherwise be spent sending teams from village to village their findings have now been published in the journal big data the multidisciplinary team came together in the course of discussions at mit s sidney pacific graduate dormitory explains team member brian spatocco we started talking about this problem and we realized we all had skills that were relevant the team s proposal gained them a prize last year from the mit ideas global challenge which helped get the project rolling and enabled team members to visit rural areas in india last summer to test their image processing system against conditions on the ground the group which grew to include an mit alumnus at new york based datakind datacorps and another researcher there focused on two initial projects in india and africa though they stress that their software solutions could be applied to many other kinds of projects and other regions selecting villages for aid the first project was to select villages in sub saharan africa for a program of unrestricted cash grants to help people in low income rural areas improve their standard of living by enabling them to buy equipment livestock or whatever they felt best met their needs the system adopted by the grant giving agency was to target the poorest villages selected by counting the percentage of houses with thatched roofs compared with those topped by more expensive metal roofs a task that had been carried out by fieldworkers on the ground the second project was selecting villages in rural parts of india for installation of microgrids to supply electricity from solar panels and battery storage systems and then figuring out the optimum sites for those panels and the most efficient network configuration for distributing that power in both cases the key first element is automating the task of figuring out where the buildings are within a satellite image for this research the team used two kinds of satellite imagery google earth which has three color channels in their images corresponding to red green and blue and commercial satellite imagery that also includes a near infrared channel that provides additional information for detecting vegetation and other features identifying structures the process begins by having people examine the satellite images visually and pick out the houses these manually selected examples are then entered in as training data for a machine learning system that attempts to generalize the criteria for determining what is a house and what isn t and then can try to predict in a new image where the houses are says george chen a co author of the paper one of the challenges he explains is that it s not always clear whether a given structure is two houses close together or two parts of the same building in other cases the house color is similar to the ground color though that s less common he says but as more examples get processed by the system over time the computers can learn from the hand picked set and get better at figuring out where the houses are spatocco says then in the case of the african aid project which is currently making unconditional cash transfers in villages in kenya and uganda an additional step is used to distinguish houses that have metal roofs which are much more reflective than thatched ones in the project for installing microgrids in india once the locations of houses are determined the computer runs thousands of different variations of where solar panels battery packs and distribution wires could be located this allows the team to pick the configurations that can provide power to the greatest number of houses with the least wiring needed to minimize the costs the program can also select configurations based on other local criteria such as a village that specifically wants its solar panels in a particular location the team says that the general algorithms they ve developed could have many other uses beyond the two specific projects they initially tested for example there is little data on demographic changes in india in terms of which areas have gained or lost population and by

much faster also posted below computer chips clocks have stopped getting faster to keep delivering performance improvements chipmakers are instead giving chips more processing units or cores which can execute computations in parallel but the ways in which a chip carves up computations can make a big difference to performance in a paper daniel sanchez the tibco founders assistant professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science and his student nathan beckmann described a system that cleverly distributes data around multicore chips memory banks improving execution times by percent on average while actually increasing energy efficiency this month at the institute of electrical and electronics engineers international symposium on high performance computer architecture members of sanchez s group have been nominated for a best paper award for an extension of the system that controls the distribution of not only data but computations as well in simulations involving a core chip the system increased computational speeds by percent while reducing power consumption by percent now that the way to improve performance is to add more cores and move to larger scale parallel systems we ve really seen that the key bottleneck is communication and memory accesses sanchez says a large part of what we did in the previous project was to place data close to computation but what we ve seen is that how you place that computation has a significant effect on how well you can place data nearby disentanglement the problem of jointly allocating computations and data is very similar to one of the canonical problems in chip design known as place and route the place and route problem begins with the specification of a set of logic circuits and the goal is to arrange them on the chip so as to minimize the distances between circuit elements that work in concert this problem is what s known as np hard meaning that as far as anyone knows for even moderately sized chips all the computers in the world couldn t find the optimal solution in the lifetime of the universe but chipmakers have developed a number of algorithms that while not absolutely optimal seem to work well in practice adapted to the problem of allocating computations and data in a core chip these algorithms will arrive at a solution in the space of several hours sanchez beckmann and po an tsai another student in sanchez s group developed their own algorithm which finds a solution that is more than percent as efficient as that produced by standard place and route algorithms but it does so in milliseconds what we do is we first place the data roughly sanchez says you spread the data around in such a way that you don t have a lot of memory banks overcommitted or all the data in a region of the chip then you figure out how to place the computational threads so that they re close to the data and then you refine the placement of the data given the placement of the threads by doing that three step solution you disentangle the problem in principle beckmann adds that process could be repeated with computations again reallocated to accommodate data placement and vice versa but we achieved percent so we stopped he says that s what it came down to really keeping tabs the mit researchers system monitors the chip s behavior and reallocates data and threads every milliseconds that sounds fast but it s enough time for a computer chip to perform million operations during that span the monitor randomly samples the requests that different cores are sending to memory and it stores the requested memory locations in an abbreviated form in its own memory circuit every core on a chip has its own cache a local high speed memory bank where it stores frequently used data on the basis of its samples the monitor estimates how much cache space each core will require and it tracks which cores are accessing which data the monitor does take up about percent of the chip s area which could otherwise be allocated to additional computational circuits but sanchez believes that chipmakers would consider that a small price to pay for significant performance improvements there was a big national academy study and a darpa sponsored information science and technology study on the importance of communication dominating computation says david wood a professor of computer science at the university of wisconsin at madison what you can see in some of these studies is that there is an order of magnitude more energy consumed moving operands around to the computation than in the actual computation itself in some cases it s two orders of magnitude what that means is that you need to not do that the mit researchers have a proposal that appears to work on practical problems and can get some pretty spectacular results wood says it s

that recruits viewers to create high level conceptual outlines blind reviews by experts in the topics covered by the videos indicated that the outlines produced by the new system were as good as or better than those produced by other experts the outlines also serve as navigation tools so viewers already familiar with some of a video s content can skip ahead while others can backtrack to review

really hard because it s not that visually dynamic so we thought that having this semantic information about the video really helps kim is a member of the user interface design group at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory which is led by rob miller a professor of computer science and engineering and another of the paper s co authors a major topic of research in miller s group is the clever design of computer interfaces to harness the power of crowdsourcing or distributing simple but time consuming tasks among large numbers of paid or unpaid online volunteers joining kim and miller on the paper are first author sarah weir an undergraduate who worked on the project through the mit undergraduate research opportunities program and krzysztof gajos an associate professor of computer science at harvard university high concept video several studies in the past five years particularly those by richard catrambone a psychologist at georgia tech have demonstrated that accompanying how to videos with step by step instructions improves learners mastery of the concepts presented but before beginning work on their crowdsourced video annotation systems the mit and harvard researchers conducted their own user study they hand annotated several video tutorials on the use of the graphics program photoshop and presented the videos either with or without the annotations to study subjects the subjects were then assigned a task that drew on their new skills and the results were evaluated by photoshop experts the work of the subjects who d watched the annotated videos scored higher with the experts and the subjects themselves reported greater confidence in their abilities and satisfaction with the tutorials last year at the association for computing machinery s conference on human factors in computing systems the researchers presented a system for distributing the video annotation task among paid workers recruited through amazon s mechanical turk crowdsourcing service their clever allocation and proofreading scheme got the cost of high quality video annotation down to a minute that system produced low level step by step instructions but work by catrambone and others had indicated that learners profited more from outlines that featured something called subgoal labeling subgoal labeling is an educational theory that says that people think in terms of hierarchical solution structures kim explains say there are different steps to make a cake such as adding sugar salt baking soda egg butter and things like that this could be just a random series of steps if you re a novice but what if the instruction instead said first deal with all the dry ingredients and then it talked about the specific steps then it moved onto the wet ingredients and talked about eggs and butter and milk that way your mental model of the solution is much better organized division of labor the system reported in the new paper dubbed crowdy produces subgoal labels and does so essentially for free each of a video s first viewers will find it randomly paused at some point whereupon the viewer will be asked to characterize the previous minute of instruction after enough candidate descriptions have been amassed each subsequent viewer will at one of the same points be offered three alternative characterizations of the preceding minute once a consensus emerges crowdy identifies successive minutes of video with similar characterizations and merges their labels finally another group of viewers is asked whether the resulting labels are accurate and if not to provide alternatives the researchers tested crowdy with a group of videos about three common web programming languages which were culled from youtube the videos were posted on the crowdy website for a month during which they attracted about viewers roughly one fifth of those viewers participated in the experiment producing an average of eight subgoal labels per video in ongoing work the researchers are expanding the range of topics covered by the videos on the crowdy website they re also investigating whether occasionally pausing the videos and

investigator in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail a former student now at microsoft research and several eecs graduate students have analyzed data structures called priority codes and dodged logjams using skip code read more in the january mit news office article by larry hardesty titled parallelizing common algorithms researchers revamp a common data structure so that it will work with multicore chips also posted below every undergraduate computer science major takes a course on data structures which describes different ways of organizing data in a computer s memory every data structure has its own advantages some are good for fast retrieval some for efficient search some for quick insertions and deletions and so on today hardware manufacturers are making computer chips faster by giving them more cores or processing units but while some data structures are well adapted to multicore computing others are not in principle doubling the number of cores should double the efficiency of a computation with algorithms that use a common data structure called a priority queue that s been true for up to about eight cores but adding any more cores actually causes performance to plummet at the association for computing machinery s symposium on principles and practice of parallel programming in february researchers from mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory will describe a new way of implementing priority queues that lets them keep pace with the addition of new cores in simulations algorithms using their data structure continued to demonstrate performance improvement with the addition of new cores up to a total of cores a priority queue is a data structure that as its name might suggest sequences data items according to priorities assigned them when they re stored at any given time only the item at the front of the queue the highest priority item can be retrieved priority queues are central to the standard algorithms for finding the shortest path across a network and for simulating events and they ve been used for a host of other applications from data compression to network scheduling with multicore systems however conflicts arise when multiple cores try to access the front of a priority queue at the same time the problem is compounded by modern chips reliance on caches high speed memory banks where cores store local copies of frequently used data as you re reading the front of the queue the whole front of the queue will be in your cache says justin kopinsky an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and one of the new paper s co authors all of these guys try to put the first element in their cache and then do a bunch of stuff with it but then somebody writes to it and it invalidates everybody else s cache and this is like an order of magnitude slowdown maybe multiple orders of magnitude loosening up to avoid this problem kopinsky fellow graduate student jerry li their advisor professor of computer science and engineering nir shavit and microsoft research s dan alistarh a former student of shavit s relaxed the requirement that each core has to access the first item in the queue if the items at the front of the queue can be processed in parallel which must be the case for multicore computing to work anyway they can simply be assigned to cores at random but a core has to know where to find the data item it s been assigned which is harder than it sounds data structures generally trade ease of insertion and deletion for ease of addressability you could for instance assign every position in a queue its own memory address to find the fifth item you would simply go to the fifth address but then if you wanted to insert a new item between say items four and five you d have to copy the last item in the queue into the first empty address then copy the second to last item into the address you just vacated and so on until you d vacated address five priority queues are constantly being updated so this approach is woefully impractical an alternative is to use what s known as a linked list each element of a linked list consists of a data item and a pointer to the memory address of the next element inserting a new element between elements four and five is then just a matter of updating two pointers road less traveled the only way to find a particular item in a linked list however is to start with item one and follow the ensuing sequence of pointers this is a problem if multiple cores are trying to modify data items simultaneously say that a core has been assigned element five it goes to the head of the list and starts working its way down but another core is already in the process of modifying element three so the first core has to sit and wait until it s done the mit researchers break this type of logjam by repurposing yet another data structure called a skip list the skip list begins with a linked list and builds a hierarchy of linked lists on top of it only say half the elements in the root list are included in the list one layer up the hierarchy only half the elements in the second layer are included in the third and so on the skip list was designed to make moving through a linked list more efficient to find a given item in the root list you follow the pointers through the top list until you identify the gap into which it falls

chlipala develops ur web a new programming language for web developmentshare december adam chilpala principal investigator in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail and the douglas ross career development professor of software technology has developed a new programming language called ur web that promises to take the drudgery out of web development providing both an easier way for developers to write web applications and a compiler that turns high level instructions into machine executable code ur web which chlipala will present at the association of computing machinery s symposium on principles of programming languages also demonstrates greater security read more in the dec mit news office article by larry hardesty title taking the grunt work out of web development new programming language automatically coordinates interactions between web page components also posted below a web page today is the result of a number of interacting components like cascading style sheets xml code ad hoc database queries and javascript functions for all but the most rudimentary sites keeping track of how these different elements interact refer to each other and pass data back and forth can be a time consuming chore in a paper being presented at the association for computing machinery s symposium on principles of programming languages adam chlipala the douglas ross career development professor of software technology describes a new programming language called ur web that lets developers write web applications as self contained programs the language s compiler the program that turns high level instructions into machine executable code then automatically generates the corresponding xml code and style sheet specifications and embeds the javascript and database code in the right places in addition to making web applications easier to write ur web also makes them more secure let s say you want to have a calendar widget on your web page and you re going to use a library that provides the calendar widget and on the same page there s also an advertisement box that s based on code that s provided by the ad network chlipala says what you don t want is for the ad network to be able to change how the calendar works or the author of the calendar code to be able to interfere with delivering the ads ur web automatically prohibits that kind of unauthorized access between page elements typing scoping ur web s ability to both provide security protection and coordinate disparate web technologies stems from two properties it shares with most full blown programming languages like c or java one is that it is strongly typed that means that any new variable that a programmer defines in ur web is constrained to a particular data type similarly any specification of a new function has to include the type of data the function acts on and the type of data it returns in computing the value to return the function may need to create new variables a function that returned an average of values in a database for instance would first need to calculate their sum but those variables are inaccessible to the rest of the program this is the second property known as variable scoping because it limits the scope the breadth of accessibility of variables defined within functions you might want to write a library that has inside of it as private state the database table that records usernames and passwords chlipala says you don t want any other part of your application to be able to just read and overwrite passwords most web frameworks don t support that style they assume that every part of your program has complete access to the database typing helps with security too many web development frameworks generate database queries in such a way that someone ostensibly logging into a website can type code into the username field that in fact overwrites data in the database with ur web usernames would constitute their own data type which would be handled much differently than database queries meeting expectations typing is also what enables coordination across web technologies suppose that a bit of javascript code is supposed to act on data fetched from a database and that the result is supposed to be displayed on a web page at a location determined by some xml code if an ur web programmer wrote a database query that extracted data of a type the javascript wasn t expecting or if the javascript generated an output of a type that the xml page wasn t expecting the compiler would register the discrepancy and flag the code as containing an error often code that isn t explicitly typed still has implicit consistency rules for instance if you write a query in the sql database language that asks for the average numerical value of a bunch of text fields the database server will tell you that it can t process your request to enable ur web to coordinate the flow of data between web technologies chlipala had to create libraries of new data types for sql xml and cascading style sheets css that embody these rules while the ur web compiler does generate xml javascript and sql code in its current version it doesn t produce style sheets automatically but chlipala says one thing the compiler can do is analyze your full program and say here is an exhaustive list of all the css classes that might be mentioned and here is a description of the context in which each class might be used which tells you what properties might be worth setting so for instance some particular class might never be used in a position where table properties would have any meaning so you don t have to bother setting those mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

stribling in photo frank dabek in recent years the field of academic publishing has ballooned to an estimated peer reviewed journals churning out some million articles per year while this growth has led to more scientific scholarship critics argue that it has also spurred increasing numbers of low quality predatory publishers who spam researchers with weekly calls for papers and charge steep fees for articles that they often don t even read before accepting ten years ago a few students at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail had noticed such unscrupulous practices and set out to have some mischievous fun with it jeremy stribling ms phd dan aguayo meng and max krohn phd spent a week or two between class projects to develop scigen a program that randomly generates nonsensical computer science papers complete with realistic looking graphs figures and citations scigen emerged out of krohn s previous work as co founder of the online study guide sparknotes which included a generator of high school essays that was based on context free grammar scigen works like an academic mad libs of sorts arbitrarily slotting in computer science buzzwords like distributed hash tables and byzantine fault tolerance the program was crude but it did the trick in april of the team s submission rooter a methodology for the typical unification of access points and redundancy was accepted as a non reviewed paper to the world multiconference on systemics cybernetics and informatics wmsci a conference that krohn says is known for being spammy and having loose standards when the researchers revealed their hoax calls started coming in from the likes of the boston globe cnn and the bbc stribling s phone was ringing off the hook thanks to his name being listed first on the paper randomly listed first he adds proudly in the wake of the international media attention wmsci withdrew the team s invitation to attend not to be deterred the students raised to travel to orlando florida where they rented out a room inside the conference space to hold their own session of randomly generated talks outfitted with fake names fake business cards and fake moustaches at the time the stunt may have seemed like nothing more than a silly gotcha moment in the tradition of the sokal affair in which an nyu physicist wrote a nonsense paper that was accepted by a journal of postmodern cultural studies but scigen has actually had a surprisingly substantial impact with many researchers using it to expose conferences with low submission standards the team s antics spurred the the world s largest organization of technical professionals the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee to pull its sponsorship of wmsci in ieee and springer publishing removed more than papers from their sites after a french researcher s analysis determined that they were generated via scigen just a few weeks ago springer announced the release of scidetect an open source tool that

later the team s creation improbably lives on stribling says the generator still gets annual pageviews that manage to crash their csail research site every few months the creators continue to get regular emails from computer science students proudly linking to papers they ve snuck into conferences as well as notes from researchers urging them to make versions for other disciplines our initial intention was simply to get back at these people who were spamming us and to maybe make people more cognizant of these practices says stribling before deadpanning we accomplished our goal way better

to poke fun at conferences ridiculous jargon filled names we combined almost pronounceable acronyms with random buzzwords cribbed from the scigen grammar to evoke the kind of niche specialization that

breaches are never out of the news for long but lately they ve been hogging the headlines the sony hack the uber hack and last month the revelation that an international gang of cybercriminals had

technology public policy and organizational management at an event at mit s stata center the home of the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail with more than students academics and industry representatives in attendance mit faculty and administrators unveiled three new cybersecurity initiatives to be housed at csail and the mit sloan school of management funded with a million grant from the hewlett foundation the mit cybersecurity policy initiative will pool the expertise of researchers at csail mit sloan the mit departments of political science and economics and the science technology and society program to better characterize the security dynamics of large networked systems with the aim of guiding policymakers cybersecurity csail will provide funding and coordination for the lab s ongoing research into hardware and software based approaches to computer security while mit sloan s interdisciplinary consortium for improving critical infrastructure in cybersecurity or ic will focus on the human element how organizations can ensure that their employees or volunteers are not creating security vulnerabilities whether intentionally or not the launch event was emceed by maria zuber mit s vice president for research and the speakers included representatives of each of the three initiatives and mit president l rafael reif in his opening remarks reif emphasized both the new initiatives partnerships with industry and the interdependence of their research programs new technologies will require new policies and incentives he said emerging policies must adapt to future technologies and none of that matters if they cannot make the present a safe place to do business security by default reif was followed by daniela rus the viterbi professor of electrical engineering and computer science and director of csail rus began by emphasizing mit s long history of involvement in cybersecurity as the home of one of the first computers to allow multiple simultaneous users it was also the birthplace of the computer password but rus also gave some sense of what the future of cybersecurity would look like many of today s cybersecurity issues stem from older poorly designed systems that viewed security as an afterthought she said organizations learned to patch and pray planning to manage attacks as they happened rather than fighting them systematically but we can change that instead of looking for patches we can move towards security by default rus then introduced howard shrobe a principal research scientist at csail who will direct cybersecurity csail shrobe elaborated on rus s historical observations pointing out that the researchers who developed mit s multiuser computer under the auspices of project mac in fact wrote an operating system that had security by default but the computers of the time simply weren t powerful enough to execute its security protocols efficiently today however on every criterion that you can think of machines are times more powerful than when project mac started shrobe said we can now start to use those resources to enforce security in a systematic way cybersecurity csail shrobe added would focus on three themes prevention or designing systems that are harder to hack resilience or designing systems that can offer secure transactions even after they ve been compromised and regeneration or designing systems that can repair themselves when breaches are detected the founding member companies of cybersecurity csail are bae systems bbva boeing bp and raytheon square one danny weitzner a csail principal research scientist and director of the new cybersecurity policy initiative took the podium next no one weitzner said neither researchers nor policy makers has a very good understanding of the dynamics of cybersecurity but that doesn t prevent policy makers from trying to control them the united states government in last year s budget is spending over billion on cybersecurity efforts weitzner said that s percent of discretionary spending weitzner then offered an example from his own two year stint as the u s deputy chief technology officer for internet policy during that time he said the u s congress was debating the stop online piracy act which included what weitzner called a seemingly simple proposal to require internet service providers to use some features of the domain name system to block access to content pirates websites discussions of the proposal elicited a letter from distinguished internet engineers including mit s david clark who was the internet s chief architect for most of the s who argued that tampering with the internet s domain name system which translates human readable urls into machine readable ip addresses could have potentially disastrous consequences their intuition as really good internet engineers was that it could cause some problems weitzner said but really there was no science presented no formal model of the interaction between the domain name system and the rest of the internet certainly no understanding of how individuals would behave at large scales generating that type of multidisciplinary model

support through the hewlett foundation s cyber initiative simultaneous funding to mit stanford university and the university of california at berkeley is intended to jump start a new field of cyber policy research the idea is to generate a robust marketplace of ideas about how best to enhance the trustworthiness of computer systems while respecting individual privacy and free expression rights encouraging innovation and supporting the broader public interest with the new awards the hewlett foundation has now allocated million over the next five years to strengthening cybersecurity the largest ever private commitment to this nascent field choices we are making today about internet governance and security have profound implications for the future to make those choices well it is imperative that they be made with a sense of what lies ahead and still more important of where we want to go says larry kramer president of the hewlett foundation we view these grants as providing seed capital to begin generating thoughtful options i ve had the pleasure of working closely with larry kramer throughout this process his dedication and the hewlett foundation s remarkable generosity provide an opportunity for mit to make a meaningful and lasting impact on cybersecurity policy mit president l rafael reif says i am honored by the trust that the foundation has placed in mit and excited about the possibilities that lie ahead each of the three universities will take complementary approaches to addressing this challenge mit s cpi will focus on establishing quantitative metrics and qualitative models to help inform policymakers stanford s cyber x initiative will focus on the core themes of trustworthiness and governance of networks and uc berkeley s center for internet security and policy will be organized around assessing the possible range of future paths cybersecurity might take interdisciplinary approach the institute wide cpi will bring together scholars from three key disciplinary pillars engineering social science and management engineering is vital to understanding the architectural dynamics of the digital systems in which risk occurs social science can help explain institutional behavior and frame policy solutions while management scholars offer insight on practical approaches to institutionalize best practices in operations mit has a strong record of applying interdisciplinary approaches to large scale problems from energy to cancer for example the mit energy initiative has brought together faculty from across campus including the social sciences to conduct energy studies designed to inform future energy options and research these studies include technology policy reports focused on nuclear power coal natural gas and the smart electric grid we re very good at understanding the system dynamics on the one hand then translating that understanding into concrete insights and recommendations for policymakers and we ll bring that expertise to the understanding of connected digital systems and cybersecurity that s our unique contribution to this challenge says daniel weitzner the principal investigator for the cpi and a principal research scientist in mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail developing a more formal understanding of the security behavior of large scale systems is a crucial foundation for sound public policy as an analogy weitzner says imagine trying to shape environmental policy without any way of measuring carbon levels in the atmosphere and no science to assess the cost or effectiveness of carbon mitigation tools this is the state of cybersecurity policy today growing urgency but no metrics and little science he says csail is home to much of the technology that is at the core of cybersecurity such as the rsa cryptography algorithm that protects most online financial transactions and the development of web standards via the mit based world wide web consortium that gives us the ability to have our hands on the evolution of these technologies to learn about how to make them more trustworthy says weitzner who was the united states deputy chief technology officer for internet policy in the white house from to while on leave from his longtime position at mit first steps in pioneering a new field of study cpi s first challenge is to identify key research questions select appropriate methodologies to guide the work and establish patterns of cross disciplinary collaboration research challenges include how policymakers should address security risks to personal health information how financial institutions can reduce risk by sharing threat intelligence developing cybersecurity policy frameworks for autonomous vehicles like drones and self driving cars and how to achieve regional and even global agreements on both privacy and security norms in online environments to address these issues cpi will not only bring to bear different disciplines from across mit from computer science to management to political science but also engage with stakeholders outside the institute including government industry and civil society organizations we want to

programmers accuracy requirements read more in the oct mit news office article by larry hardesty titled harnessing error prone chips new system would allow programmers to easily trade computational accuracy for energy savings also posted below as transistors get smaller they also grow less reliable increasing their operating voltage can help but that means a corresponding increase in power consumption with information technology consuming a steadily growing fraction of the world s energy supplies some researchers and hardware manufacturers are exploring the possibility of simply letting chips botch the occasional computation in many popular applications video rendering for instance users probably wouldn t notice the difference and it could significantly improve energy efficiency at this year s object oriented programming systems languages and applications oopsla conference researchers from mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory presented a new system that lets programmers identify sections of their code that can tolerate a little error the system then determines which program instructions to assign to unreliable hardware components to maximize energy savings while still meeting the programmers accuracy requirements the system dubbed chisel also features a tool that helps programmers evaluate precisely how much error their programs can tolerate if percent of the pixels in an image are improperly rendered will the user notice how about percent or percent chisel will simulate the execution of the image rendering algorithm on unreliable hardware as many times as the programmer requests with as many different error rates that takes the guesswork out determining accuracy requirements the researchers tested their system on a handful of common image processing and financial analysis algorithms using a range of unreliable hardware models culled from the research literature in simulations the resulting power savings ranged from to percent accumulating results the new work builds on a paper presented at last year s oospla which described a programming language called rely each paper won one of the conference s best paper awards rely provides the mechanism for specifying the accuracy requirements and it features an operator a period or dot that indicates that a particular instruction may be executed on unreliable hardware in the work presented last year programmers had to insert the dots by hand chisel does the insertion automatically and guarantees that its assignment will maximize energy savings one of the observations from all of our previous research was that usually the computations we analyzed spent most of their time on one or several functions that were really computationally intensive says sasa misailovic a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and lead author on the new paper we call those computations kernels and we focused on them misailovic is joined on the paper by his advisor martin rinard a professor in the department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs by sara achour and zichao qi who are also students in rinard s group and by michael carbin who did his phd with rinard and will join the eecs faculty next year in practice misailovic says programs generally have only a few kernels in principle chisel could have been designed to find them automatically but most developers who work on high performance code will probably want to maintain a degree of control over what their programs are doing rinard says and generally they already use tools that make kernel identification easy combinatorial explosion a single kernel however may still consist of or more instructions any combination of which could be assigned to unreliable hardware manually canvassing all possible combinations and evaluating their effects on both computational accuracy and energy savings would still be a prohibitively time consuming task but the researchers developed three separate mathematical expressions that describe accuracy of computation reliability of instruction execution and energy savings as functions of the individual instructions these expressions constrain the search that the system has to perform to determine which instructions to assign to unreliable hardware that simpler though still complex problem is one that off the shelf software can handle i think it s brilliant work says luis ceze an associate professor of computer science and engineering at the university of washington all the trends point to future hardware being unreliable because that s one way of making it more energy efficient and faster ceze points out however that the hardware model the mit researchers used requires specification of the reliability with which individual operations are executed that limits the savings that you can get from approximation ceze says i believe in approximation that is much coarser grained you do a whole bunch of operations in one shot approximately that can take you from tens of percent to tens of multiples in terms of performance and energy efficiency improvement as for whether the mit researchers work can be adapted to accommodate such a model it could be done ceze says in fact my group has done similar work in a different context so it s definitely viable mit electrical engineering computer science

medard teams to determine security level guarantees for protecting datashare october professor muriel medard working with eecs graduate student flavio du pin calmon and researchers from maynooth university in ireland have shown that since existing practical cryptographic schemes demonstrate elements of information theoretic security thereby preventing extraction of some of their data it is possible to calculate minimum security guarantees for any given encryption scheme enabling information managers to make more informed decisions about how to protect data read more in the oct mit news office article by larry hardesty titled raising cryptography s standards calculating encryption schemes theoretical security guarantees eases comparison improvement also posted below most modern cryptographic schemes rely on computational complexity for their security in principle they can be cracked but that would take a prohibitively long time even with enormous computational resources there is however another notion of security information theoretic security which means that even an adversary with unbounded computational power could extract no useful information from an encrypted message cryptographic schemes that promise information theoretical security have been devised but they re far too complicated to be practical in a series of papers presented at the allerton conference on communication control and computing researchers at mit and maynooth university in ireland have shown that existing practical cryptographic schemes come with their own information theoretic guarantees some of the data they encode can t be extracted even by a computationally unbounded adversary the researchers show how to calculate the minimum security guarantees for any given encryption scheme which could enable information managers to make more informed decisions about how to protect data by investigating these limits and characterizing them you can gain quite a bit of insight about the performance of these schemes and how you can leverage tools from other fields like coding theory and so forth for designing and understanding security systems says flavio du pin calmon a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on all three allerton papers his advisor muriel m dard the cecil e green professor of electrical engineering and computer science is also on all three papers they re joined by colleagues including ken duffy of maynooth and mayank varia of mit s lincoln laboratory the researchers mathematical framework also applies to the problem of data privacy or how much information can be gleaned from aggregated and supposedly anonymized data about internet users online histories if for instance netflix releases data about users movie preferences is it also inadvertently releasing data about their political preferences calmon and his colleagues technique could help data managers either modify aggregated data or structure its presentation in a way that minimizes the risk of privacy compromises staying close to get a sense of how the technique works imagine an encryption scheme that takes only three possible inputs or plaintexts a b and c and produces only three possible outputs or ciphertexts for each ciphertext there is some probability that it encodes each of the three plaintexts the ciphertexts can be represented as points inside a triangle whose vertices represent the three possible plaintexts the higher the probability that a given ciphertext encodes a particular plaintext the closer it is to the corresponding vertex ciphertexts more likely to encode a than b or c are closer to vertex a than to vertices b and c a secure encryption scheme is one in which the points describing the ciphertexts are clustered together rather than spread out around the triangle that means that no ciphertext gives an adversary any more information about the scheme than any other of course for most encrypted messages there are way more than three possible corresponding plaintexts even a plaintext as simple as a nine digit number has a billion possible values so the probabilities corresponding to an encoded social security number would describe a point in a billion dimensional space but the general principle is the same schemes that yield closely clustered points are good while schemes that don t are not an adversary wouldn t actually know the probabilities associated with any given ciphertext even someone with access to an encryption scheme s private key would have difficulty calculating them for their analyses calmon m dard and their colleagues developed security metrics that hold for a wide range of distributions and they augmented them with precise calculation of the worst cases the points farthest from the center of the main cluster but the mathematical description of the degree to which the probabilities cluster together is a direct indication of how much information an adversary could in principle extract from a ciphertext targeted protection in their first allerton paper in the researchers used this probabilistic framework to demonstrate that while a ciphertext as a whole may not be information theoretically secure some of its bits could be it should thus be possible to devise encryption schemes that can t guarantee perfect security across the board but could provide it for particular data say a social security number talking with cryptographers they would always ask us oh cool you can guarantee that regardless of what you do you can hide individual symbols what about functions of the plaintext calmon says standard cryptographic definitions of security care about that an encryption scheme might that is guarantee that an adversary can t extract an encoded social security number but it might still allow the adversary to extract the last four digits of the number similarly it might prevent an adversary from determining a subject s age but it

forget hide and seek katabi develops new d motion tracking for multi room visibility share december prof dina katabi principal investigator in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab at mit working with members of her research group netmit has developed a d motion tracking system that has potential for gaming and far more read more in the csail dec article by abby abazorius appearing on the mit news office website titled new system allows for high accuracy through wall d motion tracking technology could revolutionize gaming fall detection among the elderly and more also posted below in its entirety imagine playing a video game like call of duty or battlefield and having the ability to lead your virtual army unit while moving freely throughout your house gaming could become this realistic thanks to new technology developed by dina katabi s research group at the mit computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail that allows for highly accurate d motion tracking the new system dubbed witrack uses radio signals to track a person through walls and obstructions pinpointing her d location to within to centimeters about the width of an adult hand the researchers will present their findings during the usenix symposium on networked systems design and implementation in april today if you are playing a game with the xbox kinect or nintendo wii you have to stand right in front of your gaming console which limits the types of games you can play says katabi a professor of computer science and engineering and co director of the mit center for wireless networks and mobile computing imagine playing an interactive video game that transforms your entire home into a virtual world the game console tracks you as you run down real hallways away from video game enemies or as you hide from other players behind couches and walls this is what witrack can bring to video gaming earlier this year katabi and her graduate student fadel adib unveiled wivi a system that detects humans through walls and can track the direction of their movement using wifi signals based on this earlier work katabi and adib developed witrack in collaboration with rob miller a professor of computer science and engineering and graduate student zach kabelac in comparison to wivi witrack has significantly higher accuracy and can track both two dimensional and three dimensional movement using specialized radio waves as opposed to wifi signals witrack operates by tracking specialized radio signals reflected off a person s body to pinpoint location and movement the system uses multiple antennas one for transmitting signals and three for receiving the system then builds a geometric model of the user s location by transmitting signals between the antennas and using the reflections off a person s body to estimate the distance between the antennas and the user witrack is able to locate motion with significantly increased accuracy as opposed to tracking devices that rely on wireless signals according to adib because of the limited bandwidth you cannot get very high location accuracy using wifi signals adib says witrack transmits a very low power radio signal times smaller than wifi and times smaller than what your cell phone can transmit but the signal is structured in a particular way to measure the time from when the signal was transmitted until the reflections come back witrack has a geometric model that maps reflection delays to the exact location of the person the model can also eliminate reflections off walls and furniture to allow us to focus on tracking human motion in other motion tracking systems users must carry a wireless device or stand directly in front of the sensing device in order for the device to pick up movement by using specialized radio signals witrack frees users from wireless devices and allows them to roam spaces freely while still providing high accuracy localization the system s ability to track motion through obstructions could make it particularly useful not only in gaming but also in tracking elderly patients at high risk of falling current approaches to fall detection require individuals to continuously wear sensors or install cameras in the person s home while witrack does not require individuals to wear sensors or install cameras it can still detect falls with very high accuracy the ability of the witrack system to perform high accuracy localization without expending enormous amounts of computational power is a promising new development in motion tracking technology according to victor bahl a principal researcher and director of mobility and networking research at microsoft research motion tracking has generally been accomplished by analyzing images captured from strategically placed cameras inside the room a limitation of such systems is that they only work when the moving object is directly in the camera s line of sight bahl says another problem is that image analysis is a computationally heavyweight operation the technology professor katabi and her students have developed does not have these limitations he adds their system detects movement without requiring a huge amount of computational power and without having to be placed inside the room the surprising thing is that it is very accurate there is still more research to be done but the approach is promising the team is currently working on advancing the witrack system so that it can track more than one person in motion at a time the researchers believe the system should be easily adaptable to commercial settings the system is not expensive or time consuming to produce and it could be miniaturized for easier production and use kabelac says for more information on witrack please visit http witrack

researchers develop basic computing elements for bacteriashare july helen knight mit news correspondent sensors memory switches and circuits can be encoded in a common gut bacterium illustration depicts bacteroides thetaiotaomicron white living on mammalian cells in the gut large pink cells coated in microvilli and being activated by exogenously added chemical signals small green dots to express specific genes such as those encoding light generating luciferase proteins glowing bacteria image by janet iwasa the friendly bacteria inside our digestive systems are being given an upgrade which may one day allow them to be programmed to detect and ultimately treat diseases such as colon cancer and immune disorders in a paper published today in the journal cell systems researchers at mit unveil a series of sensors memory switches and circuits that can be encoded in the common human gut bacterium bacteroides thetaiotaomicron these basic computing elements will allow the bacteria to sense memorize and respond to signals in the gut with future applications that might include the early detection and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer researchers have previously built genetic circuits inside model organisms such as e coli however such strains are only found at low levels within the human gut according to timothy lu an associate professor of biological engineering and of electrical engineering and computer science who led the research alongside christopher voigt a professor of biological engineering at mit we wanted to work with strains like b thetaiotaomicron that are present in many people in abundant levels and can stably colonize the gut for long periods of time lu says the team developed a series of genetic parts that can be used to precisely program gene expression within the bacteria using these parts we built four sensors that can be encoded in the bacterium s dna that respond to a signal to switch genes on and off inside b thetaiotaomicron voigt says these can be food additives including sugars which allow the bacteria to be controlled by the food that is eaten by the host voigt adds bacterial memory to sense and report on pathologies in the gut including signs of bleeding or inflammation the bacteria will need to remember this information and report it externally to enable them to do this the researchers equipped b thetaiotaomicron with a form of genetic memory they used a class of proteins known as recombinases which can record information into bacterial dna by recognizing specific dna addresses and inverting their direction the researchers also implemented a technology known as crispr interference which can be used to control which genes are turned on or off in the bacterium the researchers used it to modulate the ability of b thetaiotaomicron to consume a specific nutrient and to resist being killed by an antimicrobial molecule the researchers demonstrated that their set of genetic tools and switches functioned within b thetaiotaomicron colonizing the gut of mice when the mice were fed food containing the right ingredients they showed that the bacteria could remember what the mice ate expanded toolkit the researchers now plan to expand the application of their tools to different species of bacteroides that is because the microbial makeup of the gut varies from person to person meaning that a particular species might be the dominant bacteria in one patient but not in others we aim to expand our genetic toolkit to a wide range of bacteria that are important commensal organisms in the human gut lu says the concept of using microbes to sense and respond to signs of disease could also be used elsewhere in the body he adds in addition more advanced genetic computing circuits could be built upon this genetic toolkit in bacteroides to enhance their performance as noninvasive diagnostics and therapeutics for example we want to have high sensitivity and specificity when diagnosing disease with engineered bacteria lu says to achieve this we could engineer bacteria to detect multiple biomarkers and only trigger a response when they are all present tom ellis group leader of the centre for synthetic biology at imperial college london who was not involved in the research says the paper takes many of the best tools that have been developed for synthetic biology applications with e coli and moves them over to use with a common class of gut bacteria whereas others have developed tools and applications for engineering genetic circuits or biosensors in bacteria that are then placed in the gut this paper stands out from the crowd by first engineering a member of the bacteroides genus the most common type of bacteria found in our guts ellis says the study has so far shown the efficacy of the approach in mice and there will be a long road ahead before it can be approved for use in humans ellis says however the paper really opens up the possibility of one day having engineered cells resident in our guts for long periods of time he says these could do tasks like sensing and recording or even in situ synthesis of therapeutic molecules as and when they

india lies in a simple device the team developed that is smaller than a shoebox the power management unit pmu performs a variety of tasks regulating how electricity from solar panels or other sources gets directed to immediate uses such as powering lights and cellphones or to batteries for later use at the same time the pmu monitors how much power is going to each user providing a record that can be used for billing without a need for individual meters mit doctoral students wardah inam and daniel strawser under the guidance of electrical engineering professors rajeev ram and david perreault will head to india next week along with several other team members to spend the summer doing field tests of the system along the way they will stop off in seoul south korea to present an account of their work at the international conference on power electronics earning extra revenue test installations will take place in two villages in the jamshedpur area in northeastern india one of which has no outside power source at all and one of which is connected to the grid but gets only intermittent access averaging two to three hours of electricity a day some people in these villages have never interacted with this kind of technology before inam says of the findings from their previous trips where they met with village leaders and residents to discuss their needs a few of the villages houses already have small simple solar power systems set up to power a few low power led lights and charge cellphones these early solar installations inam explains will now provide their owners with an opportunity to earn revenue by selling excess power to neighbors who lack any source of electricity unlike typical solar installations in the area where every lamp fan or charger is hard wired to the system the new mit designed systems will allow for flexibility in adding or removing lights or other devices adding extra power sources including more solar panels or other sources such as diesel generators and adding connections for additional users over time while most of the world s electric grid systems use ac alternating current the new mit systems operate entirely on dc direct current which greatly simplifies setup lowers costs and is safer for users to operate since the typical uses of electricity in these settings lighting charging phones and powering fans are all either inherently dc systems or can easily be converted to dc and solar panels by their nature produce dc this simplification eliminates the need for multiple devices to convert dc to ac and back again and because it is designed to operate at less than volts the systems are not capable of delivering life threatening shocks even if wiring gets damaged and people are accidentally exposed to bare wires the researchers say designing for local needs rather than bringing in a system designed by outsiders inam says the idea is for locals to develop a system to meet their own specific needs and preferences we want to empower the people to build a grid she explains already some in these villages can afford to pay for solar installations at their homes or can obtain a loan to finance it but being able to sell some of that power to other nearby homes through a microgrid could enable users to buy larger systems with some of the cost defrayed by power sales meanwhile those neighbors without having to pay any upfront installation costs would get the benefit of power for lights and charging for an estimated cost of to a month less than what they pay now for lighting using kerosene or candles inam says for the same amount they ll get better safer lighting as well as other services phone charging is one high demand service that would be met by such a system cellphone service is widespread in india and other developing nations but people often have to travel to a nearby city or pay steep prices locally to charge their phones in

lincoln laboratory read more in the april mit news office article by larry hardesty titled better sensors for medical imaging contraband detection magnetic field detector is times more efficient than its predecessors also posted below mit researchers have developed a new ultrasensitive magnetic field detector that is times more energy efficient than its predecessors it could lead to miniaturized battery powered devices for medical and materials imaging contraband detection and even geological exploration magnetic field detectors or magnetometers are already used for all those applications but existing technologies have drawbacks some rely on gas filled chambers others work only in narrow frequency bands limiting their utility synthetic diamonds with nitrogen vacancies nvs defects that are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields have long held promise as the basis for efficient portable magnetometers a diamond chip about one twentieth the size of a thumbnail could contain trillions of nitrogen vacancies each capable of performing its own magnetic field measurement the problem has been aggregating all those measurements probing a nitrogen vacancy requires zapping it with laser light which it absorbs and re emits the intensity of the emitted light carries information about the vacancy s magnetic state in the past only a small fraction of the pump light was used to excite a small fraction of the nvs says dirk englund the jamieson career development assistant professor in electrical engineering and computer science and one of the designers of the new device we make use of almost all the pump light to measure almost all of the nvs the mit researchers report their new device in the latest issue of nature physics first author on the paper is hannah clevenson a graduate student in electrical engineering who is advised by senior authors englund and danielle braje a physicist at mit lincoln laboratory they re joined by englund s students matthew trusheim and carson teale who s also at lincoln lab and by tim schr der a postdoc in mit s research laboratory of electronics telling absence a pure diamond is a lattice of carbon atoms which don t interact with magnetic fields a nitrogen vacancy is a missing atom in the lattice adjacent to a nitrogen atom electrons in the vacancy do interact with magnetic fields which is why they re useful for sensing when a light particle a photon strikes an electron in a nitrogen vacancy it kicks it into a higher energy state when the electron falls back down into its original energy state it may release its excess energy as another photon a magnetic field however can flip the electron s magnetic orientation or spin increasing the difference between its two energy states the stronger the field the more spins it will flip changing the brightness of the light emitted by the vacancies making accurate measurements with this type of chip requires collecting as many of those photons as possible in previous experiments clevenson says researchers often excited the nitrogen vacancies by directing laser light at the surface of the chip only a small fraction of the light is absorbed she says most of it just goes straight through the diamond we gain an enormous advantage by adding this prism facet to the corner of the diamond and coupling the laser into the side all of the light that we put into the diamond can be absorbed and is useful covering the bases the researchers calculated the angle at which the laser beam should enter the crystal so that it will remain confined bouncing off the sides like a tireless cue ball ricocheting around a pool table in a pattern that spans the length and breadth of the crystal before all of its energy is absorbed you can get close to a meter in path length englund says it s as if you had a meter long diamond sensor wrapped into a few millimeters as a consequence the chip uses the pump laser s energy times as efficiently as its predecessors did because of the geometry of the nitrogen vacancies the re emitted photons emerge at four distinct angles a lens at one end of the crystal can collect percent of them and focus them onto a light detector which is enough to yield a reliable measurement nv centers are very nice to work with says frank narducci a physicist at the u s naval air systems command you just have this little solid state sample you don t have to do anything to it you don t have to put it in a vacuum you don t have to cryogenically cool it to get them excited you can just use a green laser a laser pointer is good enough you don t have to have anything super fancy in the way of stabilized lasers what s cool about this is that they re using the sample itself kind of like a waveguide to bounce the light around he continues their

perovskite and dye sensitized solar cells courtesy of the researchers read more in the march mit news office article by david l chandler titled analysis sees many promising pathways for solar photovoltaic power new study identifies the promise and challenges facing large scale deployment of solar photovoltaics also posted below use of solar photovoltaics has been growing at a phenomenal rate worldwide installed capacity has seen sustained growth averaging percent per year since to evaluate the prospects for sustaining such growth the mit researchers look at possible constraints on materials availability and propose a system for evaluating the many competing approaches to improved solar cell performance the analysis is presented in the journal energy environmental science a broader analysis of solar technology economics and policy will be incorporated in a forthcoming assessment of the future of solar energy by the mit energy initiative the team comprised mit professors vladimir bulovi tonio buonassisi and robert jaffe and graduate students joel jean and patrick brown one useful factor in making meaningful comparisons among new photovoltaic technologies they conclude is the complexity of the light absorbing material the report divides the many technologies under development into three broad classes wafer based cells which include traditional crystalline silicon as well as alternatives such as gallium arsenide commercial thin film cells including cadmium telluride and amorphous silicon and emerging thin film technologies which include perovskites organic materials dye sensitized solar cells and quantum dots with the recent evolution of solar technology says jean the paper s lead author it s important to have a uniform framework for assessment it may be time he says to re examine the traditional classification of these technologies generally into three areas silicon wafer based cells thin film cells and exotic technologies with high theoretical efficiencies we d like to build on the conventional framework says jean a doctoral student in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science we re seeking a more consistent way to think about the wide range of current photovoltaic technologies and to evaluate them for potential applications in this study we chose to evaluate all relevant technologies based on their material complexity under this scheme traditional silicon a single element crystalline material is the simplest material while crystalline silicon is a mature technology with advantages including high efficiency proven reliability and no material scarcity constraints it also has inherent limitations silicon is not especially efficient at absorbing light and solar panels based on silicon cells tend to be rigid and heavy at the other end of the spectrum are perovskites organics and colloidal quantum dots which are highly complex materials but can be much simpler to process jean says the authors make clear that their definition of material complexity as a key parameter for comparison does not imply any equivalency with complexity of manufacturing on the contrary while silicon is the simplest solar cell material silicon wafer and cell production is complex and expensive requiring extraordinary purity and high temperatures by contrast while some complex nanomaterials involve intricate molecular structures such materials can be deposited quickly and at low temperatures onto flexible substrates nanomaterial based cells could even be transparent to visible light which could open up new applications and enable seamless integration into windows and other surfaces the authors caution however that the conversion efficiency and long term stability of these complex emerging technologies is still relatively low as they write in the paper the road to broad acceptance of these new technologies in conventional solar markets is inevitably long although the unique qualities of these evolving solar technologies lightweight paper thin transparent could open entirely new markets accelerating their adoption the study does caution that the large scale deployment of some of today s thin film technologies such as cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium diselenide may be severely constrained by the amount of rare materials that they require the study highlights the need for novel thin film technologies that are based on earth abundant materials the study identifies three themes for future research and development the first is increasing the power conversion efficiency of emerging photovoltaic technologies and commercial modules a second research theme is reducing the amount of material needed per cell thinner more flexible films and substrates could reduce cell weight and cost potentially opening the door to new approaches to photovoltaic module design a third important research theme is reducing the complexity and cost of manufacturing here the researchers emphasize the importance of eliminating expensive high temperature processing and encouraging the adoption of roll to roll coating processes for rapid large scale manufacturing of emerging thin film technologies we ve looked at a number of key metrics for different applications jean says we don t want to rule out any of the technologies he says but by providing a unified framework for comparison he says the researchers hope to make it easier for people to make decisions about the best technologies for a given application martin green

metabolic master switch underlying human obesityshare august helen knight mit news correspondent researchers find pathway that controls metabolism by prompting fat cells to store or burn fat illustration of fat cells in the human body image shutterstock obesity is one of the biggest public health challenges of the st century affecting more than million people worldwide obesity costs at least billion each year in the united states alone and contributes to potentially fatal disorders such as cardiovascular disease type diabetes and cancer but there may now be a new approach to prevent and even cure obesity thanks to a study led by researchers at mit and harvard medical school and published today in the new england journal of medicine by analyzing the cellular circuitry underlying the strongest genetic association with obesity the researchers have unveiled a new pathway that controls human metabolism by prompting our adipocytes or fat cells to store fat or burn it away obesity has traditionally been seen as the result of an imbalance between the amount of food we eat and how much we exercise but this view ignores the contribution of genetics to each individual s metabolism says senior author manolis kellis a professor of computer science and a member of mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail and of the broad institute new mechanism found the strongest association with obesity resides in a gene region known as fto which has been the focus of intense scrutiny since its discovery in however previous studies have failed to find a mechanism to explain how genetic differences in the region lead to obesity many studies attempted to link the fto region with brain circuits that control appetite or propensity to exercise says first author melina claussnitzer a visiting professor at csail and instructor in medicine at beth israel deaconess medical center and harvard medical school our results indicate that the obesity associated region acts primarily in adipocyte progenitor cells in a brain independent way to recognize the cell types where the obesity associated region may act the researchers used annotations of genomic control switches across more than tissues and cell types they found evidence of a major control switchboard in human adipocyte progenitor cells suggesting that genetic differences may affect the functioning of human fat stores to study the effects of genetic differences in adipocytes the researchers gathered adipose samples from healthy europeans carrying either the risk or the non risk version of the region they found that the risk version activated a major control region in adipocyte progenitor cells which turned on two distant genes irx and irx control of thermogenesis follow up experiments showed that irx and irx act as master controllers of a process known as thermogenesis whereby adipocytes dissipate energy as heat instead of storing it as fat thermogenesis can be triggered by exercise diet or exposure to cold and occurs both in mitochondria rich brown adipocytes that are developmentally related to muscle and in beige adipocytes that are instead related to energy storing white adipocytes early studies of thermogenesis focused primarily on brown fat which plays a major role in mice but is virtually nonexistent in human adults claussnitzer says this new pathway controls thermogenesis in the more abundant white fat stores instead and its genetic association with obesity indicates it affects global energy balance in humans the researchers predicted that a genetic difference of only one nucleotide is responsible for the obesity association in risk individuals a thymine t is replaced by a cytosine c nucleobase which disrupts repression of the control region and turns on irx and irx this then turns off thermogenesis leading to lipid accumulation and ultimately obesity by editing a single nucleotide position using the crispr cas system a technology that allows researchers to make precise changes to a dna sequence the researchers could switch between lean and obese signatures in human pre adipocytes switching the c to a t in risk individuals turned off irx and irx restored thermogenesis to non risk levels and switched off lipid storage genes knowing the causal variant underlying the obesity association may allow somatic genome editing as a therapeutic avenue for individuals carrying the risk allele kellis says but more importantly the uncovered cellular circuits may allow us to dial a metabolic master switch for both risk and non risk individuals as a means to counter environmental lifestyle or genetic contributors to obesity success in human and mouse cells the researchers showed that they could indeed manipulate this new pathway to reverse the signatures of obesity in both human cells and mice in primary adipose cells from either risk or non risk individuals altering the expression of either irx or irx switched between energy storing white adipocyte functions and energy burning beige adipocyte functions similarly repression of irx in mouse adipocytes led to dramatic changes in whole body energy balance resulting in a reduction of body weight and all major fat stores and complete resistance to a high fat diet by manipulating this new pathway we could switch between energy storage and energy dissipation programs at both the cellular and the organismal level providing new hope for a cure against obesity kellis says the researchers are currently establishing collaborations in academia and industry to translate their findings into obesity therapeutics they are also using their approach as a model to understand the circuitry of other disease associated regions in the human genome the paper is a tour de force according to evan rosen a professor of medicine at harvard medical school who was not involved in the research the researchers present a near complete unveiling of how a genetic risk allele in a noncoding region of the genome really works rosen says it s really an extraordinary piece of science and it provides a template for how we should be approaching these genetic

bhatia teams to engineer probiotics to detect tumors in the livershare may sangeeta bhatia member of the eecs faculty of mit s koch institute for integrative cancer research and the institute for medical engineering and science and has teamed with researchers at the university of california at san diego to create a new way to detect cancer that has spread to the liver by using probiotics providing a way for earlier detection of cancers such as colon and pancreatic that typcially metastasize to the liver read more in the may mit news office article by anne trafton titled diagnosing cancer with help from bacteria engineered probiotics can detect tumors in the liver also posted below engineers at mit and the university of california at san diego ucsd have devised a new way to detect cancer that has spread to the liver by enlisting help from probiotics beneficial bacteria similar to those found in yogurt many types of cancer including colon and pancreatic tend to metastasize to the liver the earlier doctors can find these tumors the more likely that they can successfully treat them there are interventions like local surgery or local ablation that physicians can perform if the spread of disease in the liver is confined and because the liver can regenerate these interventions are tolerated new data are showing that those patients may have a higher survival rate so there s a particular need for detecting early metastasis in the liver says sangeeta bhatia the john and dorothy wilson professor of health sciences and electrical engineering and computer science at mit using a harmless strain of e coli that colonizes the liver the researchers programmed the bacteria to produce a luminescent signal that can be detected with a simple urine test bhatia and jeff hasty a professor of biology at ucsd are the senior authors of a paper describing the new approach this week in the journal science translational medicine lead authors are mit postdoc tal danino and ucsd postdoc arthur prindle microbial help previous studies had shown that bacteria can penetrate and grow in the tumor microenvironment where there are lots of nutrients and the body s immune system is compromised because of this scientists have been trying for many years to develop bacteria as a possible vehicle for cancer treatment the mit and ucsd researchers began exploring this idea a few years ago but soon expanded their efforts to include the concept of creating a bacterial diagnostic to turn bacteria into diagnostic devices the researchers engineered the cells to express the gene for a naturally occurring enzyme called lacz that cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose in this case lacz acts on a molecule injected into the mice consisting of galactose linked to luciferin a luminescent protein naturally produced by fireflies luciferin is cleaved from galactose and excreted in the urine where it can easily be detected using a common laboratory test at first the researchers were interested in developing these bacteria for injection into patients but then decided to investigate the possibility of delivering the bacteria orally just like the probiotic bacteria found in yogurt to achieve that they integrated their diagnostic circuits into a harmless strain of e coli called nissle which is marketed as a promoter of gastrointestinal health in tests with mice the researchers found that orally delivered bacteria do not accumulate in tumors all over the body but they do predictably zero in on liver tumors because the hepatic portal vein carries them from the digestive tract to the liver we realized that if we gave a probiotic we weren t going to be able to get bacteria concentrations high enough to colonize the tumors all over the body but we hypothesized that if we had tumors in the liver they would get the highest dose from an oral delivery says bhatia who is a member of mit s koch institute for integrative cancer research and institute for medical engineering and science this allowed the team to develop a diagnostic specialized for liver tumors in tests in mice with colon cancer that has spread to the liver the probiotic bacteria colonized nearly percent of the metastatic tumors in the mouse experiments animals that were given the engineered bacteria did not exhibit any harmful side effects more sensitive detection the researchers focused on the liver not only because it is a natural target for these bacteria but also because the liver is hard to image with conventional imaging techniques like ct scanning or magnetic resonance imaging mri making it difficult to diagnose metastatic tumors there with the new system the researchers can detect liver tumors larger than about one cubic millimeter offering more sensitivity than existing imaging methods this kind of diagnostic could be most useful for monitoring patients after they have had a colon tumor removed because they are at risk for recurrence in the liver bhatia says andrea califano a professor of biological sciences at columbia university says the study is seminal and thought provoking in terms of clearing a new path for investigating what can be done for early detection of cancer adding that the therapeutic possibilities are also intriguing these bacteria could be engineered to cause genetic disruption of cancer cell function deliver drugs or reactivate the immune system says califano who was not involved in the research the mit team is now pursuing the idea of using probiotic bacteria to treat cancer as well as for diagnosing it the

science and artificial intelligence lab and the broad institute has led an nih group that has created a similar map of the human epigenome this work will lead to a global map towards understanding fundamental developmental and disease processes in humans read more in the february mit news office article by helen knight titled researchers generate a reference map of the human epigenome better understanding of epigenetic modifications could elucidate their role in human traits diseases also posted below the sequencing of the human genome laid the foundation for the study of genetic variation and its links to a wide range of diseases but the genome itself is only part of the story as genes can be switched on and off by a range of chemical modifications known as epigenetic marks now a decade after the human genome was sequenced the national institutes of health s roadmap epigenomics consortium has created a similar map of the human epigenome manolis kellis a professor of computer science and a member of mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and of the broad institute led the effort to integrate and analyze the datasets produced by the project which constitute the most comprehensive view of the human epigenome to date in a paper published today in the journal nature kellis and his colleagues report reference human epigenomes and study their regulatory circuitry in a bid to understand their role in human traits and diseases the consortium set out to systematically characterize the human epigenomic landscape across diverse tissues and cell types kellis says given the enormity of the task that meant bringing together multiple mapping centers and profiling a wide range of cell and tissue samples to capture the diversity of the human epigenome billion genomic sequences the researchers generated genome wide datasets encompassing a total of billion sequencing reads corresponding to fold coverage of the human genome these captured modifications of both the dna itself and of the histone proteins around which dna is wrapped to form a structure known as chromatin kellis and his team then developed and applied machine learning algorithms that could translate these datasets into a reference map in each of the cell types and tissues the algorithms distinguished different classes of epigenomic modifications and used them to annotate the genomic regions active in each sample and in particular regulatory elements that control where and when different genes are expressed different combinations of epigenetic marks characterize different regions of the genome reflecting the specific functions that they play in each cell kellis says by studying these combinations systematically we can learn the language of the epigenome and what it is telling us about both the activity and the function of each genomic region in each of the cell types the researchers distinguished different epigenomic signatures or chromatin states reflecting active repressed poised transcribed and inactive regions of the genome in each cell type about percent of each reference epigenome showed signatures associated with a regulatory function chromatin states allowed us to summarize the complexity of diverse epigenomic marks into a small number of common patterns kellis says we could then interpret the biological functions of these patterns epigenomic dynamics the researchers then studied how these chromatin states varied across different types of cells and tissues this allowed them to group cell types with similar regulatory circuitry they also grouped together regulatory regions that are active in the same types of cells in this way they could begin to reveal the building blocks of regulatory circuits unlike the genome which is mostly unchanged across cell types the epigenome is extremely dynamic reflecting the specialization of each cell type such as neurons heart muscle liver skin blood or immune cells kellis says by studying which regions turn on and off in the same cell types we can gain insights into gene regulation the researchers grouped million predicted regulatory regions into sets or modules which appeared to be acting in a coordinated manner across different types of cells they found that of these modules contained common sequence patterns known as regulatory motifs which may be responsible for their ability to work together in this way exploiting the predicted regulators and their motifs can help dissect the circuitry of different tissues and cells kellis says the researchers also compared these epigenomic signatures with groups of genetic variants that are associated with different human traits and diseases this allowed them to produce a map of the tissue and cell types that are most relevant to each trait or disease we found that genetic variants are found in regulatory regions known as enhancers which are activated only in certain types of cell and tissue kellis says this suggests that many genetic variants affect the regulatory circuitry of the cell possibly disrupting gene functions by altering tissue specific gene expression levels tissue specific enhancers affect traits the researchers found significant tissue specific enhancer signatures for genetic variants associated with different traits these included height in embryonic stem cells multiple sclerosis in immune cells attention deficit disorder in brain tissues blood pressure in heart tissues fasting glucose in pancreatic islets cholesterol in liver tissue and alzheimer s disease in cd monocytes this unbiased view allows researchers to focus on relevant cells and tissues that may have been otherwise overlooked when studying a particular disease kellis says the regulatory circuitry of a diverse range of cells can contribute to diseases that manifest in seemingly unexpected organs using these circuits to understand

kellis teams with broad picower and other colleagues to track epigenomics of alzheimers disease progressionshare february our susceptibility to disease depends both on the genes that we inherit from our parents and on our lifetime experiences these two components nature and nurture seem to affect very different processes in the context of alzheimer s disease according to a new study published today in the journal nature professor manolis kellis teamed with li huei tsai picower professor at mit and others to do this work read more in the february mit news office article by anne trafton titled epigenomics of alzheimer s disease progression study of epigenomic modifications reveals immune basis of alzheimer s disease also posted below our susceptibility to disease depends both on the genes that we inherit from our parents and on our lifetime experiences these two components nature and nurture seem to affect very different processes in the context of alzheimer s disease according to a new study published today in the journal nature the study was carried out by an interdisciplinary team at mit and the broad institute and was co led by li huei tsai the picower professor at mit and director of the picower institute for learning and memory and manolis kellis a professor in mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail the researchers analyzed changes that occur in genes and in regions that regulate genes as alzheimer s disease progresses using a mouse model of alzheimer s disease that tsai s lab originally developed several years ago the mice were engineered so that the gene for a protein called p can be overstimulated in the brain which prompts the mice to develop symptoms very similar to alzheimer s disease in humans these programmable mice allowed us to study for the first time the changes occurring during early stages of the disease before symptoms even begin to appear tsai says we could then compare them to changes in later stages of the disease when neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment are evident opposing changes the researchers profiled multiple chemical modifications known as epigenetic marks in the hippocampus of mice expressing too much p and compared them with control mice these epigenetic marks reveal the activity of diverse genomic regions in particular the regulatory control regions that control the expression of nearby genes the researchers also directly profiled the levels of all genes we found two opposing signatures associated with disease progression that are consistent with the pathophysiology of alzheimer s disease says elizabeta gjoneska joint first author of the paper and a postdoc at the picower institute neuronal plasticity processes that are involved in learning and memory were dampened and immune and inflammatory pathways were activated the active regions specifically matched regions active in a type of immune cells known as microglia which are responsible for clearing away infected or damaged cells they also secrete chemicals that produce inflammation our data suggest that microglia are heavily activated during alzheimer s disease progression although it is unknown exactly how they contribute to the disease tsai says these cells are important for normal brain function and share their key cell surface markers cd with macrophages that infiltrate the brain from elsewhere in the body during disease progression conserved epigenomic signatures the researchers then compared the results in mice with what is known about alzheimer s disease in humans they found that differences in gene levels in the alzheimer s like mouse brain matched differences previously seen in the brains of alzheimer s patients which prompted them to ask if the epigenetic signatures might also be conserved the researchers found that this was the case specifically the same regulatory regions that were active or repressed in mice showed the same patterns in humans they also found that the regions with increased activity in the mouse model of alzheimer s disease had immune functions in humans and the regions that showed decreased activity had neural functions in humans our results show that functional conservation between human and mouse is not restricted to protein coding genes says andreas pfenning joint first author of the study and a postdoc at mit this opens up the use of epigenomics methods in model organisms to study an inaccessible organ like the brain and how it changes in response to activity or disease genetic variants cluster in immune pathways previous studies of the genomes of alzheimer s patients had identified common genetic variants associated with the disease but scientists did not know how these dna variants could contribute to the disease since the majority of them are found outside of protein coding regions our conserved epigenomic maps allowed us to now place these noncoding genetic variants in the context of disease relevant regulatory regions and interpret their contribution to the disease predisposition kellis says as inherited common genetic variants always precede disease onset they are always indicative of causal roles and thus can shed additional light on the epigenomic alterations the researchers found that genetic variants associated with alzheimer s disease were only associated with immune processes and not with neural processes indicating that genetic predisposition to alzheimer s disease primarily affects the circuitry of immune processes rather than neuronal processes our results suggest that repression of neural pathways does not represent genetic predisposition even though it is a hallmark of alzheimer s tsai says instead it may occur as a consequence of environmental factors and aging and result from interactions with the altered immune pathways the researchers identified a small number of master regulators that target many of the regulatory regions that overlap alzheimer s associated genetic variants in humans among these pu targets a large number of altered regulatory regions and the genetic region encoding pu is associated with alzheimer s disease suggesting pu as a potential therapeutic target the new focus on immune cell types and

bhatia teams in work towards eradication of malariashare february in the world health organization announced a global effort to eradicate malaria which kills about people every year as part of that goal scientists are trying to develop new drugs that target the malaria parasite during the stage when it infects the human liver crucial because some strains of malaria can lie dormant in the liver for several years before flaring up read more in the feb mit news office article by anne trafton titled new source of cells for modeling malaria liver cells derived from stem cells can be infected with malaria and used to test potential drugs also posted below a new advance by mit engineers could aid in those efforts the researchers have discovered a way to grow liver like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells these cells can be infected with several strains of the malaria parasite and respond to existing drugs the same way that mature liver cells taken from human donors do such cells offer a plentiful source for testing potential malaria drugs because they can be made from skin cells new drugs are badly needed since some forms of the malaria parasite have become resistant to existing treatments says sangeeta bhatia the john and dorothy wilson professor of health sciences and technology hst and electrical engineering and computer science at mit drug resistance is emerging that we are continually chasing the thinking behind the call to eradication is that we can t be chasing resistance and distributing bed nets to protect from mosquitoes forever ideally we would rid ourselves of the pathogen entirely says bhatia who is also a member of mit s koch institute for integrative cancer research and institute for medical engineering and science imes these cells described in the feb online issue of stem cell reports could also allow scientists to test drugs on cells from people with different genetic backgrounds who may respond differently to malaria infection and treatment the paper s lead author is shengyong ng a graduate student in mit s department of biological engineering and imes other authors of the paper are former imes postdoc robert schwartz mit research scientist sandra march imes research technician ani galstian hst graduate students nil gural and jing shan former imes research technician mythili prabhu and maria mota a researcher at the instituto de medicina molecular in portugal modeling infection until now malaria researchers have not had many reliable ways to test new drugs in liver tissue what s historically been done is people have tried to make do with the systems that were available bhatia says those systems include testing drugs in cancerous liver cells or in mice infected with a rodent specific version of the malaria parasite however cancerous cells divide much more frequently than normal adult liver cells and are missing some of the genes required for drug metabolism the mouse model is not ideal because the rodent version of malaria is different from the human one so drugs that are successful in mice don t always work in humans in bhatia and colleagues showed that they could mode malaria infection in adult liver cells known as hepatocytes taken from human donors however this generates only a limited supply from each donor and not all of the cells work well for drug studies the researchers then turned to induced pluripotent stem cells these immature cells can be generated from human skin cells by adding several genes known as reprogramming factors once the cells are reprogrammed they can be directed to form differentiated adult cells by adding specific growth factors to create liver cells the researchers added a series of growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor working with charles rice of rockefeller university and stephen duncan of the medical college of wisconsin bhatia s lab generated these cells in and used them to model infection of hepatitis c however these cells known as hepatocyte like cells did not seem to be as mature as real adult liver cells in the new study the mit team found that these cells could be infected with several strains of malaria but did not have the same drug responses as adult liver cells in particular they were not sensitive to primaquine which works only if cells have a certain set of drug metabolism enzymes found in mature liver cells this is important because primaquine is one of only two drugs approved to treat liver stage malaria and many of the drugs now in development are based on primaquine to induce the cells to become more mature and turn on these metabolic enzymes the researchers added a molecule they had identified in a previous study this compound which the researchers call a maturin stimulated the cells to turn on those enzymes which made them sensitive to primaquine treatment this study is a major breakthrough says dyann wirth chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the harvard school of public health who was not part of the research team this technique may prove not only a useful tool for finding drugs that will target the liver stage of the parasite but it could also contribute to our fundamental understanding of the parasite toward better drugs the mit team is now working with the nonprofit foundation medical malaria ventures to test about potential malaria drugs that are in the pipeline first using adult donor liver cells and then the hepatocyte like cells generated in this study these cells could also prove useful to help identify new drug targets in this study the researchers found that the liver like cells can be infected with malaria when they are still in the equivalent of fetal stages of development when they become cells known as hepatoblasts which are precursors to hepatocytes in future studies the researchers plan to investigate which genes get

voldman teams to develop means to witness communication between immune cellsshare january professor joel voldman working with eecs graduate student burak dura and others from whitehead institute and georgia institute of technology have developed a new device that allows scientists to follow communication between immune cells the work reported in the jan issue of nature communications may lead to future studies of mechanisms that involve cancer and other diseases read more in the january mit news office article by anne trafton titled watching how cells interact new device allows scientists to glimpse communication between immune cells also posted below the immune system is a complex network of many different cells working together to defend against invaders successfully fighting off an infection depends on the interactions between these cells a new device developed by mit engineers offers a much more detailed picture of that cellular communication using this device which captures pairs of cells and collects data on each as they interact with each other the researchers have already learned more about how t cells major players in the immune response become activated during infection the device is based on microfluidic technology developed by joel voldman an mit professor of electrical engineering and computer science eecs in his team used that earlier version to fuse adult cells with embryonic stem cells allowing the researchers to observe the genetic reprogramming that occurred in these hybrids after that study immunologists contacted voldman wondering if the device could be adapted to study immune cells a lot of what occurs in the immune system is cells talking to other cells by coming in contact with them says voldman one of the senior authors of a paper describing the new device in the jan issue of nature communications voldman and burak dura the paper s lead author and a graduate student in eecs spent several years re engineering the device to get it to work with immune cells which are much smaller than the cells analyzed in hidde ploegh an mit professor of biology and member of the whitehead institute for biomedical research is also a senior author of the paper controlled contact until now the most common way to measure interactions between two types of cells was to mix the cells together in a test tube and observe them however this approach has limited usefulness because there is no guarantee that each cell is interacting with only one other cell all that uncontrollability makes it hard to interpret the results you get voldman says in contrast voldman s device allows for complete control over cell pairings the device consists of a chip with cell trapping cups that are strategically arranged to capture and pair up cells first type a cells are flowed across the chip in one direction and captured in single cell traps then the flow of liquid is reversed drawing the a cells into larger traps located opposite the single cell traps when each a cell is in a large trap b cells are flowed in and each one joins an a cell in the large traps this technique allows the researchers to follow hundreds of cell pairs over time and monitor what is happening in each cell which has not been possible previously it also allows them to precisely control the timing of cell interactions we know the exact contact time and we can keep them in contact as long as they are within the cups dura says this allows us to not only measure the single cell parameters but also do measurements of the two cells together and correlate the responses with one another in the new version of the device the researchers added high resolution imaging allowing them to see when cells calcium levels fluctuate and when they turn on a type of protein signaling known as phosphorylation this is a very elegant way of doing these experiments says hang lu a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the georgia institute of technology who was not involved in the research it s very well controlled and you know exactly where to look for the cells and that makes imaging them extremely efficient and high throughput launching an immune response in the nature communications paper dura worked with stephanie dougan a former postdoc at the whitehead institute to study the interaction between t cells and b cells which is key to launching an immune response when b cells encounter viruses or bacteria they absorb them and display pieces of viral or bacterial proteins known as antigens on their cell surfaces when these b cells encounter t cells with receptors that recognize the antigen the t cells become activated provoking them to release cytokines inflammatory chemicals that control the immune response or to seek out and destroy infected cells although all of the t cells in this study had identical t cell receptors the mit team found that they did not all respond the same way after encountering b cells carrying identical antigens on their surfaces using calcium imaging to measure t cell activation the researchers found that the initial activation level depends on how much of the antigen is presented at high levels most of the cells respond the same way however at lower antigen levels the t cell responses vary greatly these differences also correlated to differences in t cell cytokine production in future studies the researchers hope to further trace how t cells go through the decision making process that determines their eventual fates they also plan to investigate other types of interactions for example how immune cells called natural killer cells recognize and destroy cancer cells the research was funded by the singapore mit alliance the aacr pancreatic cancer action network janssen

weiss teams to build practical biological circuitsshare november eecs professor ron weiss has teamed with mechanical engineering professor domitilla del vecchio and students from multiple departments at mit to create a device that allows large biological circuits that behave with predictability nearly like that of electronic circuits the work published this week in the journal nature biotechnology has many applications particularly biosensing left to right ron weiss professor of biological engineering domitilla del vecchio associate professor of mechanical engineering and deepak mishra mit graduate student in biological engineering photo brian teague courtesy mit news read more in the nov mit news office article by david chandler titled new device could make large biological circuits practical innovation from mit could allow many biological components to be connected to produce predictable effects also posted below researchers have made great progress in recent years in the design and creation of biological circuits systems that like electronic circuits can take a number of different inputs and deliver a particular kind of output but while individual components of such biological circuits can have precise and predictable responses those outcomes become less predictable as more such elements are combined a team of researchers at mit has now come up with a way of greatly reducing that unpredictability introducing a device that could ultimately allow such circuits to behave nearly as predictably as their electronic counterparts the findings are published this week in the journal nature biotechnology in a paper by associate professor of mechanical engineering domitilla del vecchio and professor of biological engineering ron weiss the lead author of the paper is deepak mishra an mit graduate student in biological engineering other authors include recent master s students phillip rivera in mechanical engineering and allen lin in electrical engineering and computer science there are many potential uses for such synthetic biological circuits del vecchio and weiss explain one specific one we re working on is biosensing cells that can detect specific molecules in the environment and produce a specific output in response del vecchio says one example cells that could detect markers that indicate the presence of cancer cells and then trigger the release of molecules targeted to kill those cells it is important for such circuits to be able to discriminate accurately between cancerous and noncancerous cells so they don t unleash their killing power in the wrong places weiss says to do that robust information processing circuits created from biological elements within a cell become highly critical weiss says to date that kind of robust predictability has not been feasible in part because of feedback effects when multiple stages of biological circuitry are introduced the problem arises because unlike in electronic circuits where one component is physically connected to the next by wires that ensure information is always flowing in a particular direction biological circuits are made up of components that are all floating around together in the complex fluid environment of a cell s interior information flow is driven by the chemical interactions of the individual components which ideally should affect only other specific components but in practice attempts to create such biological linkages have often produced results that differed from expectations if you put the circuit together and you expect answer x and instead you get answer y that could be highly problematical del vecchio says the device the team produced to address that problem is called a load driver and its effect is similar to that of load drivers used in electronic circuits it provides a kind of buffer between the signal and the output preventing the effects of the signaling from backing up through the system and causing delays in outputs while this is relatively early stage research that could take years to reach commercial application the concept could have a wide variety of applications the researchers say for example it could lead to synthetic biological circuits that constantly measure glucose levels in the blood of diabetic patients automatically triggering the release of insulin when it is needed the addition of this load driver to the arsenal of components available to those designing biological circuits del vecchio says could escalate the complexity of circuits you could design opening up new possible applications while ensuring that their operation is robust and predictable james collins a professor of biomedical engineering at boston university who was not associated with this research says efforts in synthetic biology to create complex gene circuits are often hindered by unanticipated or uncharacterized interactions between submodules of the circuits these interactions alter the input output characteristics of the submodules leading to undesirable circuit behavior but now collins says del vecchio and weiss have made a major advance for the field by creating a genetic device that can account for and correct for such interactions leading to more predictable circuit behavior the research was supported by an eni mit energy research fellowship the national science foundation the u s

develops genomic memory share november timothy lu associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and biological engineering has come up with a new reason to engineer e coli so that genomic memory can be both long term and analog not just on or off the work appears in the latest online issue of science and in the scientist magazine read more in the nov mit news office article by anne trafton titled bacteria become genomic tape recorders engineered e coli can store long term memories of chemical exposure other events in their dna also posted below image above courtesy christine daniloff mit news mit engineers have transformed the genome of the bacterium e coli into a long term storage device for memory they envision that this stable erasable and easy to retrieve memory will be well suited for applications such as sensors for environmental and medical monitoring you can store very long term information says timothy lu an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and biological engineering you could imagine having this system in a bacterium that lives in your gut or environmental bacteria you could put this out for days or months and then come back later and see what happened at a quantitative level the new strategy described in the nov issue of the journal science overcomes several limitations of existing methods for storing memory in bacterial genomes says lu the paper s senior author those methods require a large number of genetic regulatory elements limiting the amount of information that can be stored the earlier efforts are also limited to digital memory meaning that they can record only all or nothing memories such as whether a particular event occurred lu and graduate student fahim farzadfard the paper s lead author set out to create a system for storing analog memory which can reveal how much exposure there was or how long it lasted to achieve that they designed a genomic tape recorder that lets researchers write new information into any bacterial dna sequence stable memory to program e coli bacteria to store memory the mit researchers engineered the cells to produce a recombinase enzyme which can insert dna or a specific sequence of single stranded dna into a targeted site however this dna is produced only when activated by the presence of a predetermined molecule or another type of input such as light after the dna is produced the recombinase inserts the dna into the cell s genome at a preprogrammed site we can target it anywhere in the genome which is why we re viewing it as a tape recorder because you can direct where that signal is written lu says once an exposure is recorded through this process the memory is stored for the lifetime of the bacterial population and is passed on from generation to generation there are a couple of different ways to retrieve this stored information if the dna is inserted into a nonfunctional part of the genome sequencing the genome will reveal whether the memory is stored in a particular cell or researchers can target the sequences to alter a gene for example in this study the new dna sequence turned on an antibiotic resistance gene allowing the researchers to determine how many cells had gotten the memory sequence by adding antibiotics to the cells and observing how many survived by measuring the proportion of cells in the population that have the new dna sequence researchers can determine how much exposure there was and how long it lasted in this paper the researchers used the system to detect light a lactose metabolite called iptg and an antibiotic derivative called atc but it could be tailored to many other molecules or even signals produced by the cell lu says the information can also be erased by stimulating the cells to incorporate a different piece of dna in the same spot this process is currently not very efficient but the researchers are working to improve it this work is very exciting because it integrates many useful capabilities in a single system long lasting analog distributed genomic storage with a variety of readout options says shawn douglas an assistant professor at the university of california at san diego who was not involved in the study rather than treating each individual cell as a digital storage device farzadfard and lu treat an entire population of cells as an analog hard drive greatly increasing the total amount of information that can be stored and retrieved bacterial sensors environmental applications for this type of sensor include monitoring the ocean for carbon dioxide levels acidity or pollutants in addition the bacteria could potentially be designed to live in the human digestive tract to monitor someone s dietary intake such as how much sugar or fat is being consumed or to detect inflammation from irritable bowel disease these engineered bacteria could also be used as biological computers lu says adding that they would be particularly useful in types of computation that require a lot of parallel processing such as picking patterns out of an image because there are billions and billions of bacteria in a given test tube and now we can start leveraging more of that population for memory storage and for computing it might be interesting to do highly parallelized computing it might be slow but it could also be energy efficient he says another possible application is engineering brain cells of living animals or human cells grown in a petri dish to allow researchers to track whether a certain disease marker is expressed or whether a neuron is active at a certain time if you could turn the dna inside a cell into a little memory device on its own and then link that to something you care about you can write that information and then later extract

yanik teams to devise drug delivery pipeline using nanoparticlesshare september mehmet fatih yanik has teamed to create a drug delivery pipeline using nanoparticles enabling rapid testing in zebrafish for eventual delivery to human subjects of biologics including antibodies peptides rna and dna read more in the sept mit news office article by anne trafton titled high speed drug screen engineers devise technology for rapidly testing drug delivery vehicles in zebrafish also posted below mit engineers have devised a way to rapidly test hundreds of different drug delivery vehicles in living animals making it easier to discover promising new ways to deliver a class of drugs called biologics which includes antibodies peptides rna and dna to human patients in a study appearing in the journal integrative biology the researchers used this technology to identify materials that can efficiently deliver rna to zebrafish and also to rodents this type of high speed screen could help overcome one of the major bottlenecks in developing disease treatments based on biologics it is challenging to find safe and effective ways to deliver them biologics is the fastest growing field in biotech because it gives you the ability to do highly predictive designs with unique targeting capabilities says senior author mehmet fatih yanik an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and biological engineering however delivery of biologics to diseased tissues is challenging because they are significantly larger and more complex than conventional drugs by combining this work with our previously published high throughput screening system we are able to create a drug discovery pipeline with efficiency we had never imagined before adds tsung yao chang a recent mit phd recipient and one of the paper s lead authors peng shi a former mit postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the university of hong kong is the paper s other lead author fish on the fly zebrafish are commonly used to model human diseases in part because their larvae are transparent making it easy to see the effects of genetic mutations or drugs in yanik s team developed a technology for rapidly moving zebrafish larvae to an imaging platform orienting them correctly and imaging them this kind of automated system makes it possible to do large scale studies because analyzing each larva takes less than seconds compared with the several minutes it would take for a scientist to evaluate the larvae by hand for this study yanik s team developed a new technology to inject rna carried by nanoparticles called lipidoids previously designed by daniel anderson an associate professor of chemical engineering member of the koch institute for integrative cancer research and institute for medical engineering and science and an author of the new paper these fatty molecules have shown promise as delivery vehicles for rna interference a process that allows disease causing genes to be turned off with small strands of rna yanik s group tested about lipidoids that had not performed well in tests of rna delivery in cells grown in a lab dish they designed each lipidoid to carry rna expressing a fluorescent protein allowing them to easily track rna delivery and injected the lipidoids into the spinal fluid of the zebrafish to automate that process the zebrafish were oriented either laterally or dorsally once they arrived on the viewing platform once the larvae were properly aligned they were immobilized by a hydrogel then the lipidoid rna complex was automatically injected guided by a computer vision algorithm the system can be adapted to target any organ and the process takes about seconds per fish a few hours after injection the researchers imaged the zebrafish to see if they displayed any fluorescent protein in the brain indicating whether the rna successfully entered the brain tissue was taken up by the cells and expressed the desired protein the researchers found that several lipidoids that had not performed well in cultured cells did deliver rna efficiently in the zebrafish model they next tested six randomly selected best and worst performing lipidoids in rats and found that the correlation between performance in rats and in zebrafish was percent suggesting that zebrafish are a good model for predicting drug delivery success in mammals the ability to identify useful drug delivery nanoparticles using this miniaturized system holds great potential for accelerating our discovery process anderson says the lipidoid material screen is just an example demonstrated in this article a similar strategy can be readily extended to other libraries or other organ systems peng adds jeff karp an associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school who was not part of the research team says this work is an excellent example of harnessing a multidisciplinary team to partner complementary technologies for the purpose of solving a unified problem yanik and colleagues who have extensive expertise with high throughput screening in zebrafish and other small animals have teamed up with anderson et al who are leading experts in rna delivery to create a new platform for rapidly screening biologics and methods to deliver them this approach should have utility across multiple disease areas new leads the researchers are now using what they learned about the most successful lipidoids identified in this study to try to design even better possibilities if we can pick up certain design features from the screens it can guide us to design larger combinatorial libraries based on these leads yanik says yanik s lab is currently using this technology to find delivery vehicles that can carry biologics

do you shrink data when it is big share may how do you shrink data when it is too big mit s richard peng a postdoc in applied mathematics and michael cohen a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science have developed and demonstrated an algorithm that is optimal for condensing matrices data read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled to handle big data shrink it algorithm reduces size of data sets while preserving their mathematical properties also posted below as anyone who s ever used a spreadsheet can attest it s often convenient to organize data into tables but in the age of big data those tables can be enormous with millions or even hundreds of millions of rows one way to make big data analysis computationally practical is to reduce the size of data tables or matrices to use the mathematical term by leaving out a bunch of rows the trick is that the remaining rows have to be in some sense representative of the ones that were omitted in order for computations performed on them to yield approximately the right results at the acm symposium on theory of computing in june mit researchers will present a new algorithm that finds the smallest possible approximation of the original matrix that guarantees reliable computations for a class of problems important in engineering and machine learning this is a significant improvement over previous techniques and for all classes of problems the algorithm finds the approximation as quickly as possible in order to determine how well a given row of the condensed matrix represents a row of the original matrix the algorithm needs to measure the distance between them but there are different ways to define distance one common way is so called euclidean distance in euclidean distance the differences between the entries at corresponding positions in the two rows are squared and added together and the distance between rows is the square root of the resulting sum the intuition is that of the pythagorean theorem the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of a right triangle s legs gives the length of the hypotenuse another measure of distance is less common but particularly useful in solving machine learning and other optimization problems it s called manhattan distance and it s simply the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding entries in the two rows inside the norm in fact both manhattan distance and euclidean distance are instances of what statisticians call norms the manhattan distance or norm is the first root of the sum of differences raised to the first power and the euclidean distance or norm is the square root of the sum of differences raised to the second power the norm is the cube root of the sum of differences raised to the third power and so on to infinity in their paper the mit researchers richard peng a postdoc in applied mathematics and michael cohen a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science demonstrate that their algorithm is optimal for condensing matrices under any norm but according to peng the one we really cared about was the norm in matrix condensation under any norm the first step is to assign each row of the original matrix a weight a row s weight represents the number of other rows that it s similar to and it determines the likelihood that the row will be included in the condensed matrix if it is its values will be multiplied according to its weight so for instance if rows are good stand ins for each other but not for any other rows of the matrix each will have a percent chance of getting into the condensed matrix if one of them does its entries will all be multiplied by so that it will reflect the contribution of the other nine rows it s standing in for although manhattan distance is in some sense simpler than euclidean distance it makes calculating rows weights more difficult previously the best algorithm for condensing matrices under the norm would yield a matrix whose number of rows was proportional to the number of columns of the original matrix raised to the power of the best algorithm for condensing matrices under the norm however would yield a matrix whose number of rows was proportional to the number of columns of the original matrix times its own logarithm that means that if the matrix had columns under the norm the best possible condensation before peng and cohen s work was a matrix with hundreds of thousands of rows under the norm it was a matrix with a couple of hundred rows that discrepancy grows as the number of columns increases taming recursion peng and cohen s algorithm condenses matrices under the norm as well as it does under the norm under the norm it condenses matrices as well as its predecessors do that s because for the norm it simply uses the best existing algorithm for the norm it uses the same algorithm but it uses it five or six times the paper s real contribution is to mathematically prove that the norm algorithm will yield reliable results under the norm as peng explains an equation for calculating norm weights has been known for some time but the funny thing with that definition is that it s recursive he says so the correct set of weights appears on both the left hand side and the right hand side that is the weight for a given matrix row call it w is set equal to a mathematical expression that itself includes w this definition was known to exist but people in stats didn t know what to do with it peng says they look at it and think how do

algorithm that removes reflections from photos taken through windows photo mit researchers have created a new algorithm that in a broad range of cases can automatically remove reflections from digital

researchers read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled removing reflections from photos taken through windows new algorithm exploits multiple reflections in individual images to distinguish reflection from transmission also posted below it s hard to take a photo through a window without picking up reflections of the objects behind you to solve that problem professional photographers sometimes wrap their camera lenses in dark cloths affixed to windows by tape or suction cups but that s not a terribly attractive option for a traveler using a point and shoot camera to capture the view from a hotel room or a seat in a train at the computer vision and pattern recognition conference in june mit researchers will present a new algorithm that in a broad range of cases can automatically remove reflections from digital photos the algorithm exploits the fact that photos taken through windows often feature two nearly identical reflections slightly offset from each other in boston the windows are usually double paned windows for heat isolation during the winter says yichang shih who completed his phd in computer science at mit this spring and is first author on the paper with that kind of window there s one reflection coming from the inner pane and another reflection from the outer pane but thick windows are usually enough to produce a double reflection too the inner side will give a reflection and the outer side will give a reflection as well without the extra information provided by the duplicate reflection the problem of reflection removal is virtually insoluble shih explains you have an image from outdoor and another image from indoor and what you capture is the sum of these two pictures he says if a b is equal to c then how will you recover a and b from a single c that s mathematically challenging we just don t have enough constraints to reach a conclusion thinning the field the second reflection imposes the required constraint now the problem becomes recovering a b and c from a single d but the value of a for one pixel has to be the same as the value of b for a pixel a fixed distance away in a prescribed direction that constraint drastically reduces the range of solutions that the algorithm has to consider nonetheless a host of solutions still remain to home in on one of them shih and his coauthors professors of computer science and engineering fr do durand and bill freeman who were shih s thesis advisors and dilip krishnan a former postdoc in freeman s group who s now at google research assume that both the reflected image and the image captured through the window have the statistical regularities of so called natural images the basic intuition is that at the level of small clusters of pixels in natural images unaltered representations of natural and built environments abrupt changes of color are rare and when they do occur they occur along clear boundaries so if a small block of pixels happens to contain part of the edge between a blue object and a red object everything on one side of the edge will be bluish and everything on the other side will be reddish in computer vision the standard way to try to capture this intuition is with the notion of image gradients which characterize each block of pixels according to the chief direction of color change and the rate of change but shih and his colleagues found that this approach didn t work very well playing the odds ultimately they settled on a new technique co developed by daniel zoran a postdoc in freeman s group zoran and yair weiss of the hebrew university of jerusalem created an algorithm that divides images into by blocks of pixels for each block it calculates the correlation between each pixel and each of the others the aggregate statistics for all the by blocks in training images proved a reliable way to distinguish reflections from images shot through glass in their paper shih and his colleagues report performing searches on google and the flickr photo database using terms like window reflection photography problems after excluding results that weren t photos shot through glass they had images of which exhibited double reflections that were offset far enough for their algorithm to work people have worked on methods for eliminating these reflections from photos but there had been drawbacks in past approaches says yoav schechner a professor of electrical engineering at israel s technion some methods attempt using a single shot this is very hard so prior results had partial success and there was no automated way of telling if the recovered scene is the one reflected by the window or the one behind the window this work does a good job on several fronts the ideas here can progress into routine photography if the algorithm is further robustified and becomes part of toolboxes used in digital photography he adds it may help robot vision in the presence of confusing glass reflection mit

artificial intelligence technique of neural networks they used it to train the most successful scene classifier yet which was between and percent more accurate than its best predecessor at the international conference on learning representations this weekend the researchers will present a new paper demonstrating that en route to learning how to recognize scenes their system also learned how to recognize objects the work implies that at the very least scene recognition and object recognition systems could work in concert but it also holds out the possibility that they could prove to be mutually reinforcing deep learning works very well but it s very hard to understand why it works what is the internal representation that the network is building says antonio torralba an associate professor of computer science and engineering at mit and a senior author on the new paper it could be that the representations for scenes are parts of scenes that don t make any sense like corners or pieces of objects but it could be that it s objects to know that something is a bedroom you need to see the bed to know that something is a conference room you need to see a table and chairs that s what we found that the network is really finding these objects torralba is joined on the new paper by first author bolei zhou a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science aude oliva a principal research scientist and agata lapedriza a visiting scientist both at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and aditya khosla another graduate student in torralba s group under the hood like all machine learning systems neural networks try to identify features of training data that correlate with annotations performed by human beings transcriptions of voice recordings for instance or scene or object labels associated with images but unlike the machine learning systems that produced say the voice recognition software common in today s cellphones neural nets make no prior assumptions about what those features will look like that sounds like a recipe for disaster as the system could end up churning away on irrelevant features in a vain hunt for correlations but instead of deriving a sense of direction from human guidance neural networks derive it from their structure they re organized into layers banks of processing units loosely modeled on neurons in the brain in each layer perform random computations on the data they re fed but they then feed their results to the next layer and so on until the outputs of the final layer are measured against the data annotations as the network receives more data it readjusts its internal settings to try to produce more accurate predictions after the mit researchers network had processed millions of input images readjusting its internal settings all the while it was about percent accurate at labeling scenes where human beings are only percent accurate since they can disagree about high level scene labels but the researchers didn t know how their network was doing what it was doing the units in a neural network however respond differentially to different inputs if a unit is tuned to a particular visual feature it won t respond at all if the feature is entirely absent from a particular input if the feature is clearly present it will respond forcefully the mit researchers identified the images that produced the strongest response in each unit of their network then to avoid biasing they sent the collections of images to paid workers on amazon s mechanical turk crowdsourcing site who they asked to identify commonalities among the images beyond category the first layer more than half of the units are tuned to simple elements lines or simple colors torralba says as you move up in the network you start finding more and more objects and there are other things like regions or surfaces that could be things like grass or clothes so they re still highly semantic and you also see an increase according to the assessments by the mechanical turk workers about half of the units at the top of the network are tuned to particular objects the other half either they detect objects but don t do it very well or we just don t know what they are doing torralba says they may be detecting pieces that we don t know

data sets simplified ai technique may aid flight delays analysis and moreshare november using artificial intelligence including probabilistic graphical models ying liu graduate student in eecs working with alan willsky eecs professor and director of the laboratory for information and decisions systems lids has developed a technique that can efficiently infer vital information about the propagation of flight delays at u s airports liu and willsky will present their work which has potential application to a wide range of areas at the neural information processing systems foundation in early december read more in the nov mit news office article by larry hardesty titled machine learning branches out an algorithm that extends an artificial intelligence technique to new tasks could aid in analysis of flight delays and social networks also posted below much artificial intelligence research is concerned with finding statistical correlations between variables what combinations of visible features indicate the presence of a particular object in a digital image what speech sounds correspond with instances of what words what medical genetic and environmental factors are correlated with what diseases as the number of variables grows calculating their aggregate statistics becomes dauntingly complex but that calculation can be drastically simplified if you know something about the structure of the data that for instance the sound corresponding to the letter t is frequently followed by the sound corresponding to the letter r but never by the sound corresponding to the letter q in a paper being presented in december at the annual conference of the neural information processing systems foundation mit researchers describe a new technique that expands the class of data sets whose structure can be efficiently deduced not only that but their technique naturally describes the data in a way that makes it much easier to work with in the paper they apply their technique to several sample data sets including information about commercial airline flights using only flights scheduled and actual departure times the algorithm can efficiently infer vital information about the propagation of flight delays through u s airports it also identifies those airports where delays are most likely to have far reaching repercussions which makes it simpler to reason about the behavior of the network as a whole thinking graphically in technical terms the researchers work concerns probabilistic graphical models in this context a graph is a mathematical construct that consists of nodes and edges usually depicted as respectively circles and the lines that connect them a network diagram is a familiar example of a graph a family tree is another in a graphical model the edges have an associated number which describes the statistical relationship between the nodes in the linguistic example the nodes representing the sounds corresponding to t and r would be connected by a highly weighted edge while the nodes corresponding to t and q wouldn t be connected at all graphical models simplify reasoning about data correlations because they eliminate the need to consider certain dependencies suppose for instance that your artificial intelligence algorithm is looking for diagnostically useful patterns in a mountain of medical data where the variables include patients symptoms their genetic information their treatment histories and prior diagnoses without the graph structure the algorithm would have no choice but to evaluate the relationships among all the variables at once but if it knows for instance that gene g is a cause of disease d which is treated with medication m which has side effect s then it has a much simpler time determining whether for instance s is a previously unidentified indicator of d a graphical model is a way of encoding those types of relationships so that they can be understood by machines historically graphical models have sped up machine learning algorithms only when they ve had a few particular shapes such as that of a tree a tree is a graph with no closed loops in a family tree for instance a closed loop would indicate something biologically impossible that say someone is both parent and sibling to the same person out of the loop according to ying liu a graduate student in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science who co wrote the new paper with his advisor alan willsky the edwin sibley webster professor of electrical engineering loops pose problems because they can make statistical inference algorithms overconfident the algorithm typically used to infer statistical relationships within graphical models liu explains is a message passing algorithm where each node sends messages to only its neighbors using only local information and incoming messages from other neighbors it s a very good way to distribute the computation if the graph has loops however a node may get some message back but this message is partly from itself so it gets overconfident about the beliefs in prior work liu and willsky showed that efficient machine learning can still happen in a loopy probabilistic graph provided it has a relatively small feedback vertex set fvs a group of nodes whose removal turns a loopy graph into a tree in the airline flight example many of the nodes in the fvs were airline hubs which have flights to a large number of sparsely connected airports the same structure is seen in other contexts in which machine learning is currently applied liu says such as social networking in the new paper they show that the structure of a graphical model can be deduced by similar means a structureless data set is equivalent to a graph in which every node is connected to every other node liu and willsky s algorithm goes through the graph sequentially removing nodes that break loops and using the efficient algorithm they demonstrated previously calculating how close the statistical dependencies of the resulting graph are to those of the fully connected graph in this manner the algorithm builds up an fvs

gets years if you don t know what your accomplice will do what s the rational decision this conundrum known as the prisoner s dilemma is the most familiar example of a game in the technical sense employed by game theorists game theory is a mathematical way to describe strategic reasoning and the prisoner s dilemma illustrates the three basic requirements of the situations it encompasses the game must involve multiple agents here the two accomplices each must make a decision squeal or don t squeal and every decision must carry a quantifiable payoff the prison terms that varies according to the other agents decisions game theory has been a staple of economics research since when john nash who taught at mit from to and is the subject of the movie a beautiful mind published the seminal paper that would win him the nobel prize in economics as game theory has matured it s become even more central to that field in just the last eight years the nobel prize has gone to game theorists three times for shedding light on among other things the logic of nuclear deterrence the circumstances in which free markets can and cannot maximize public welfare and the best solutions to matching problems organs and patients medical residents and hospitals and the like but recently game theory has been drawing attention in engineering and computer science too researchers are using it to analyze thorny problems such as optimizing traffic flow or preventing blackouts asuman ozdaglar sm phd a professor of electrical engineering and computer science says the rise of the internet has made this necessary historically the engineers of communication networks had to contend with a wide range of technical questions such as power constraints and the relative merits of centralization or decentralization but with the internet they suddenly had to deal with human agency too if a comcast subscriber in boston and an earthlink subscriber in san francisco are exchanging data their transmissions are traveling over networks maintained by several different providers comcast earthlink and others in between the whole operation relies on both collaboration and competition of these different parties ozdaglar says how do you design protocols that will actually yield the right incentives for people to collaborate in other words why does the internet work even though it is made up of individual networks game theory provides a way of answering that kind of question as engineers began bringing game theory to bear on questions within their field however they also realized that the tools of their trade were applicable to outstanding questions of game theory indeed of the handful of researchers in the department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs who work extensively on game theory all have spent substantial time on questions more typically addressed by the social sciences going once eecs professor constantinos daskalakis is a good example in he won the association for computing machinery s dissertation prize by showing how techniques drawn from theoretical computer science could shed new light on one of the central concepts in game theory equilibrium equilibrium is the idea that won nash his nobel and the nash equilibrium is the type of equilibrium most commonly studied it describes a balance of strategies that no player of a game has a motive to change unilaterally the most basic example of a nash equilibrium involves the so called penalty kick game in soccer a penalty kick gives an offensive player a free shot on goal with only the goalie defending the ball travels so quickly that the goalie has to guess which way to dive before it s struck in the game theoretical version if both players pick the same half of the goal the goalie wins if they pick different halves the shooter wins the equilibrium state for this game is for both players to pick a direction randomly on any given kick but to ensure that overall they choose both directions with equal frequency in that case they ll each win half the time and neither can improve his or her odds by deviating from that strategy for instance if the goalie suddenly started going the same direction every time and the shooter stuck to the original strategy the goalie s winning percentage would merely stay the same however a shooter who noticed the shift could win every kick by going the opposite direction every time so the goalie has no incentive to make this change but the penalty kick game is one of the simplest of games finding equilibria for even slightly more complex games can be enormously difficult in his dissertation daskalakis proved that for some situations that can be described through game theory the nash equilibrium is so hard to calculate that all the computers in the world couldn t

science after a brief foray while he was a graduate student at stanford in at a startup where he found the stimulation of contributing inspiration time was diluted by execution effort read more in the feb mit news office article by larry hardesty titled networks of probability devavrat shah spans disciplines by looking at networks probabilistically and probabilities as networks posted below in its entirety devavrat shah arrived at stanford university as a graduate student in computer science in just a few months after a couple of other students in the department sergey brin and larry page received million in financing for a company that they d started in a friend s garage which they called google the first time i met someone from outside stanford shah says the guy said oh so you re a phd in the computer science department what s the name of your startup shah now an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit had grown up in vadodara a city that he describes as small by indian standards only two million people while his father and grandfather had been professors of mechanical engineering and chemistry respectively most of his relatives had gone into business or finance with considerable success i always thought that since i come from basically a business family i should be doing business shah says indeed only a year into his graduate career shah took a leave of absence to work for a networking startup developing a cheap high speed memory circuit for the company s chips once in a while you get a problem where you can write down a perfect mathematical model for it and you get an absolutely pretty elegant solution which actually becomes highly implementable shah says this was one of those rare instances once he had extracted his elegant solution however i realized that the innovative phase is over shah says the question was would i continue in the mundane day to day job of making sure execution was happening or look for the next interesting idea unlike page and brin he decided to go back to stanford any such industrial job will be percent idea and percent execution shah says in the academy he says the ratio is more like percent idea to percent execution and that percent somehow appealed to me more he says taking turns shah says that his academic work falls into two main categories communication networks and statistical inference but even that distinction is a little misleading because he brings statistical analysis to bear on communication protocols and network models to bear on inference problems one of his major results in communication for instance was an algorithm that allows wireless devices to share access to a wireless router if two devices try to access the router at the same time their requests collide and neither is able to establish a connection the ideal communications protocol would ensure that only one device sends data to the router at a time but that over time all the devices get equal access in a setting like a coffee shop with a wi fi router where devices are constantly joining and leaving the network and no one device knows what any of the others are doing that s a demanding requirement but shah met it by adopting a statistical approach with his algorithm data transmission proceeds in rounds and each device starts off with a certain probability that in the next round it will attempt to access the router every round that it doesn t attempt a connection its probability goes up and every time it does establish a connection its probability drops initially there may be some collisions but shah was able to show that the devices will sort themselves into a pattern that over time converges on the optimal allocation of airtime graphic design conversely when shah tackles problems of statistical inference he generally treats them like networking problems he represents the problems as graphs data structures that consist of nodes usually depicted as circles and edges line segments that connect the nodes a network diagram is the most familiar example of a graph but in shah s case the nodes represent data points and the edges represent correlations between them the algorithms that establish the strength of those correlations are in fact variations on algorithms used to disseminate messages across networks shah and his group have applied their graphical approach to a wide range of inference problems one is the prediction of consumers product preferences on the basis of their buying histories in tests with a major automaker shah s algorithm predicted car buyers preferences with percent greater accuracy than existing algorithms another is predicting what topics will trend on twitter with percent accuracy shah s algorithm predicted trending topics an average of an hour and a half ahead of time and sometimes as much as four or five hours ahead in more recent work shah says his group has addressed problems with crowdsourcing a technique for breaking up information processing tasks that are difficult for computers but easy for humans and parceling them out to legions of workers recruited online typically workers are paid a small fee often just a few cents for each portion of a task that they complete inevitably some workers will pocket the fee and submit sloppy or outright fraudulent answers using graphical techniques shah s group was

to people everywhere says mit president l rafael reif his experience offers a powerful example of how a young mit graduate can give the world something truly useful i am delighted that he will share his story and some of the lessons he has learned along the way with our class of and their families and guests houston holds an sb in computer science and engineering from mit after graduating he recognized that people needed a way to bring their files with them without sending e mail attachments or carrying usb drives he began writing a solution to this problem in sharing an early version with arash ferdowsi then an mit undergraduate the two then began working on the project that would eventually become dropbox i ve had some of the most formative experiences of my life at mit houston says it s where dropbox started and where i met my co founder arash so it s an honor to come back and share my story technology is at the heart of how we shape our future and confront our challenges and more than ever the world needs mit graduates to lead us forward since dropbox s founding five years ago houston has led the company s growth from a simple idea to a service relied upon by millions

his usb drive on his desk at home leaving him with nothing to do out of frustration he opened his text editor and started writing the first lines of code of what would eventually become dropbox shortly after houston met ferdowsi through a mutual friend at mit and showed him an early version of dropbox after several meetings houston and ferdowsi decided to jump into the project together ferdowsi left mit and the two started working out of a tiny sublet in cambridge they eventually moved to san francisco and received their first venture capital investment from sequoia capital early

algorithm that lets the data decide even trends on twittershare november at the interdisciplinary workshop on information and decision in social networks at mit on november associate professor devavrat shah and his student stanislav nikolov will present a new algorithm that can with percent accuracy predict which topics will trend an average of an hour and a half before twitter s algorithm puts them on the list and sometimes as much as four or five hours before it is also designed to fit today s computational framework distributed over multiple servers read more in the nov mit news office article by larry hardesty titled predicting what topics will trend on twitter a new algorithm predicts which twitter topics will trend hours in advance and offers a new technique for analyzing data that fluctuate over time also posted below in its entirety twitter s home page features a regularly updated list of topics that are trending meaning that tweets about them have suddenly exploded in volume a position on the list is highly coveted as a source of free publicity but the selection of topics is automatic based on a proprietary algorithm that factors in both the number of tweets and recent increases in that number at the interdisciplinary workshop on information and decision in social networks at mit in november associate professor devavrat shah and his student stanislav nikolov will present a new algorithm that can with percent accuracy predict which topics will trend an average of an hour and a half before twitter s algorithm puts them on the list and sometimes as much as four or five hours before the algorithm could be of great interest to twitter which could charge a premium for ads linked to popular topics but it also represents a new approach to statistical analysis that could in theory apply to any quantity that varies over time the duration of a bus ride ticket sales for films maybe even stock prices like all machine learning algorithms shah and nikolov s needs to be trained it combs through data in a sample set in this case data about topics that previously did and did not trend and tries to find meaningful patterns what distinguishes it is that it s nonparametric meaning that it makes no assumptions about the shape of patterns let the data decide in the standard approach to machine learning shah explains researchers would posit a model a general hypothesis about the shape of the pattern whose specifics need to be inferred you d say series of trending things remain small for some time and then there is a step says shah the jamieson career development associate professor in the department of electrical engineering and computer science this is a very simplistic model now based on the data you try to train for when the jump happens and how much of a jump happens the problem with this is i don t know that things that trend have a step function shah explains there are a thousand things that could happen so instead he says he and nikolov just let the data decide in particular their algorithm compares changes over time in the number of tweets about each new topic to the changes over time of every sample in the training set samples whose statistics resemble those of the new topic are given more weight in predicting whether the new topic will trend or not in effect shah explains each sample votes on whether the new topic will trend but some samples votes count more than others the weighted votes are then combined giving a probabilistic estimate of the likelihood that the new topic will trend in shah and nikolov s experiments the training set consisted of data on twitter topics that did trend and that didn t in real time they set their algorithm loose on live tweets predicting trending with percent accuracy and a percent false positive rate shah predicts however that the system s accuracy will improve as the size of the training set increases the training sets are very small he says but we still get strong results keeping pace of course the larger the training set the greater the computational cost of executing shah and nikolov s algorithm indeed shah says curbing computational complexity is the reason that machine learning algorithms typically employ parametric models in the first place our computation scales proportionately with the data shah says but on the web he adds computational resources scale with the data too as facebook or google add customers they also add servers so his and nikolov s algorithm is designed so that its execution can be split up among separate machines it is perfectly suited to the modern computational framework shah says in principle shah says the new algorithm could be applied to any sequence of measurements performed at regular intervals but the correlation between historical data and future events may not always be as clear cut as in the case of twitter posts filtering out all the noise in the historical data might require such enormous training sets that the problem becomes computationally intractable even for a massively distributed program but if the right subset of training data can be identified shah says it will work people go to social media sites to find out what s happening now says ashish goel an associate professor of management science at stanford university and a member of twitter s technical advisory board so in that sense speeding up the process is something that is very useful of the mit researchers nonparametric approach goel says it s very creative to use the data itself to find out what trends look like it s quite creative and quite timely and hopefully quite useful mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

daskalakis students use game theory to tackle year economics problemshare june costis daskalakis eecs faculty member and principal investigator with the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail and his students yang cai and matthew weinberg have written a series of papers which address a year old economics problem having to do with auction design using the tools of game theory read about this work in the mit news office june article reproduced below computer science tackles year old economics problem mit researchers generalize nobel winner s work on single item auctions to auctions involving multiple items larry hardesty mit news office june image right courtesy mit news office in economists jargon an auction is any market that involves a single seller and a group of buyers in some auctions the seller has information about the populations from which the buyers are drawn as at a movie theater which can ask its customers to produce student ids or senior citizen cards in the university of chicago s roger myerson won the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences in part for research he had published in on auction design using the tools of game theory myerson showed how to structure an auction for a single item such that if all the bidders adopted the bidding strategies in their best interest the auctioneer would realize the greatest profit myerson s work immediately raised a related question what s the best way to organize an auction in which bidders are competing for multiple items that question has stood for years but mit computer scientists believe that they have now answered it in a pair of recent papers constantinos daskalakis the x window consortium assistant professor of computer science and engineering at mit and his students yang cai and matthew weinberg describe an algorithm for finding an almost perfect approximation of the optimal design of a multi item auction the first of the papers was presented at the association for computing machinery s th symposium on theory of computing in may the second will appear at the ieee symposium on foundations of computer science in october in economists jargon an auction is any market that involves a single seller and a group of buyers an art auction at christie s counts as an auction but so does the sale of tickets at a movie theater the movie theater just happens to be running a particular kind of auction called a fixed price auction at a christie s auction the auctioneer may not know much about individual bidders the guy in jeans and a t shirt could be the agent of a billionaire but in other types of auctions the seller has information about the populations from which buyers are drawn the movie theater for instance could check customers for student ids or senior citizen cards before offering them a discounted rate figuring out how to extract the maximum amount of money from people with differing abilities to pay is one of the things that makes auction analysis so complex according to daskalakis the difficulty of finding the optimal multi item auction suggests that it has such large complexity that there s no succinct description that gives you the optimal outcome to maximize revenue the auctioneer might have to agree to sell an item at some fraction of the highest bid a fraction that could depend on a host of factors the difference between the top two bids the final price of the previous item on the docket the populations from which the bidders are drawn maybe it s a long laundry list of allocation rules of what you have to do for every possible set of bids daskalakis says the solution but the mit researchers were able to show that while the optimal auction might be enormously complicated it can be described as a probabilistic combination of simple auctions to explain the basic idea daskalakis draws the analogy of three points that define an equilateral triangle a point in the center of the triangle daskalakis says could be thought of as percent the point at the top of the triangle percent the bottom right corner and percent the bottom left corner our result basically hinges on the fact that we view this auction design problem as a geometric problem daskalakis says and our auctions lie inside complicated shapes whose corners are simple things in particular the corners are so called vickrey clarke groves vcg auctions one of whose inventors william vickrey won the nobel prize years before myerson did what that means in practice however is that the auctioneer doesn t have to keep track of a complicated set of rules after the bidders have submitted their bids the auctioneer randomly chooses one of the vcg auctions the corners and uses its relatively simple rules to allocate the items in the docket every randomized algorithm is by definition a distribution over deterministic algorithms so the crucial thing here is not that daskalakis says the crucial thing is understanding what deterministic algorithms are in this decomposition and the important aspect of the result is that the algorithms in this decomposition happen to be of a very simple form vcg auctions when the mit researchers began their analysis they had no idea what those algorithms would turn out to be it is remarkable that they are of this type daskalakis says in the type of vcg auctions the researchers use bids are modified according to the populations from which the bidders are drawn affluent bidders might see their bids cut in half middle income bidders might see theirs boosted by percent the items in the docket are then allocated according to the modified bids not the actual bids the difference between the vcg auctions in one of the researchers decompositions is simply the numerical values of the modifications

berwick collaborates to build thesis that birdsong and primate talk are at root of human language share june eecs faculty member robert berwick principal investigator in the laboratory for information and decision systems lids has teamed with mit linguistics and philosophy professor shigeru miyagawa to reinforce the thesis that human language development is based on bird song and other primates communication with collaborators at the university of tokyo berwick and miyagawa s work titled the integration hypothesis of human language evolution and the nature of contemporary languages is published this week in frontiers in psychology read more in the june mit news office article by peter dizikes titled from contemporary syntax to human language s deep origins new paper amplifies hypothesis that human language builds on birdsong and speech forms of other primates also posted below graphic courtesy mit news office christine daniloff on the island of java in indonesia the silvery gibbon an endangered primate lives in the rainforests in a behavior that s unusual for a primate the silvery gibbon sings it can vocalize long complicated songs using different note types that signal territory and send messages to potential mates and family far from being a mere curiosity the silvery gibbon may hold clues to the development of language in humans in a newly published paper two mit professors assert that by re examining contemporary human language we can see indications of how human communication could have evolved from the systems underlying the older communication modes of birds and other primates from birds the researchers say we derived the melodic part of our language and from other primates the pragmatic content carrying parts of speech sometime within the last years those capacities fused into roughly the form of human language that we know today but how other animals it appears have finite sets of things they can express human language is unique in allowing for an infinite set of new meanings what allowed unbounded human language to evolve from bounded language systems how did human language arise it s far enough in the past that we can t just go back and figure it out directly says linguist shigeru miyagawa the kochi manjiro professor of japanese language and culture at mit the best we can do is come up with a theory that is broadly compatible with what we know about human language and other similar systems in nature specifically miyagawa and his co authors think that some apparently infinite qualities of modern human language when reanalyzed actually display the finite qualities of languages of other animals meaning that human communication is more similar to that of other animals than we generally realized yes human language is unique but if you take it apart in the right way the two parts we identify are in fact of a finite state miyagawa says those two components have antecedents in the animal world according to our hypothesis they came together uniquely in human language introducing the integration hypothesis the current paper the integration hypothesis of human language evolution and the nature of contemporary languages is published this week in frontiers in psychology the authors are miyagawa robert berwick a professor of computational linguistics and computer science and engineering in mit s laboratory for information and decision systems and shiro ojima and kazuo okanoya scholars at the university of tokyo the paper s conclusions build on past work by miyagawa which holds that human language consists of two distinct layers the expressive layer which relates to the mutable structure of sentences and the lexical layer where the core content of a sentence resides that idea in turn is based on previous work by linguistics scholars including noam chomsky kenneth hale and samuel jay keyser the expressive layer and lexical layer have antecedents the researchers believe in the languages of birds and other mammals respectively for instance in another paper published last year miyagawa berwick and okanoya presented a broader case for the connection between the expressive layer of human language and birdsong including similarities in melody and range of beat patterns birds however have a limited number of melodies they can sing or recombine and nonhuman primates have a limited number of sounds they make with particular meanings that would seem to present a challenge to the idea that human language could have derived from those modes of communication given the seemingly infinite expression possibilities of humans but the researchers think certain parts of human language actually reveal finite state operations that may be linked to our ancestral past consider a linguistic phenomenon known as discontiguous word formation which involve sequences formed using the prefix anti such as antimissile missile or anti antimissile missile missile and so on some linguists have argued that this kind of construction reveals the infinite nature of human language since the term antimissile can continually be embedded in the middle of the phrase however as the researchers state in the new paper this is not the correct analysis the word antimissile is actually a modifier meaning that as the phrase grows larger each successive expansion forms via strict adjacency that means the construction consists of discrete units of language in this case and others miyagawa says humans use finite state components to build out their communications the complexity of such language formations berwick observes doesn t occur in birdsong and doesn t occur anywhere else as far as we can tell in the rest of the animal kingdom indeed he adds as we find more evidence that other animals don t seem to posses this kind of system it bolsters our case for saying these two elements were brought together in humans an inherent capacity to be sure the researchers acknowledge their hypothesis is a work in progress after all charles darwin and others have explored the connection between birdsong and human

tsitsiklis and xu show versatility s promise share may kuang xu a graduate student in the department of electrical engineering and computer science photo right and his advisor john tsitsiklis the clarence j lebel professor of electrical engineering have demonstrated in a series of recent papers that a little versatility in operations management cloud computing and even health care delivery and manufacturing could save exponential reduction in delays read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled valuing versatility in an age of specialization a little versatility could improve operations management cloud computing and possibly even the provision of health care posted in its entirety below it s often said that we live in an age of increased specialization physicians who treat just one ailment scholars who study just one period network administrators who know just one operating system but in a series of recent papers researchers at mit s laboratory for information and decision systems lids have shown that in a number of different contexts a little versatility can go a long way their theoretical analyses could have implications for operations management cloud computing and possibly even health care delivery and manufacturing take for instance a product support call center for a company with a wide range of products it s far more cost effective to train each customer service representative on the technical specifications of a single product than on all the products but what if a bunch of calls about a product come in and the center doesn t have enough specialists to field them kuang xu a graduate student in the department of electrical engineering and computer science and his advisor john tsitsiklis the clarence j lebel professor of electrical engineering model such problems as requests arriving at a bank of network servers in a paper in the journal stochastic systems they showed that if a small percentage of servers or call center reps can field any type of request the result is an exponential reduction in delays more technically the rate at which delays increase with the volume of requests is exponentially lower that paper won the annual award for best student paper from the institute for operations research and the management sciences the largest professional society in operations research but that model is not actually very relevant for let s say a call center xu says it would be infeasible xu explains for a company with say products to train even percent of its call center employees on all of them mix and match so this summer at the annual meeting of the association for computing machinery s special interest group on performance evaluation sigmetrics xu and tsitsiklis will present a follow up paper in which all the servers in the network or reps at the call center have just a little versatility the second paper was motivated by well what is a more natural and more powerful kind of flexible structure xu explains in that scenario too the lids researchers find that versatility pays dividends the specifics vary with the number of types of requests and the number of servers but in a wide range of cases where specialized servers will incur delays servers that can each handle a few different types of requests approximately the logarithm of the total number of request types can reduce delay time to near zero that scenario is as xu says a more realistic model of the kind of expertise that could be expected from call center reps but it s also a more realistic model of how to distribute information among servers in a web services company s data center on its own the versatility of the individual servers is no guarantee of short wait times you also need a clever scheduling algorithm tsitsiklis says that s the hard part in particular the lids researchers showed the system has to wait for an adequate number of requests to come in before parceling them out to servers that number is not large for a bank of servers it might be around which would take a fraction of a second to arrive at a large web services site but that slight delay is necessary to ensure that all the requests can be handled in parallel if the first requests are parceled out as they arrive there s some chance that the only servers that can handle the th will already be busy when it arrives but waiting for provides strong statistical guarantees that a server can be found for every request a minuscule delay at the outset insures against longer delays later the road ahead xu and tsitsiklis are currently pursuing this line of research down several different avenues in the sigmetrics paper the assignment of different types of tasks to different servers is random consequently the performance guarantees are probabilistic there s still a chance no matter how tiny that tasks will be assigned in a way that introduce delays the lids researchers are currently working on a deterministic version of their algorithm meaning that tasks are assigned according to a regular pattern offering stronger performance guarantees they re also exploring variations on their model in which the flexibility is not on the supply side the servers but the demand side the requests they haven t validated the model yet but there s some evidence that a variation of their algorithm could be used to assign scarce health care resources to say patients in an emergency room some of whom might be able to wait longer than others before receiving treatment the topic of flexibility has been explored in various directions says ton dieker an assistant professor at georgia tech s algorithms and randomness center and thinktank indeed the classic literature on flexibility in manufacturing systems includes

lids researcher pairs new sensor and algorithm for faster data intake and potentially nimbler robotsshare may laboratory for information and decision systems lids research scientist andrea censi has paired a neuromorphic sensor with lightening speed camera data intake with a new algorithm to give robots a new enhanced sensory system this work will be presented at the international conference on robotics and automation see the project website for more detail read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled think fast robot algorithm that harnesses data from a new sensor could make autonomous robots more nimble also posted below one of the reasons we don t yet have self driving cars and mini helicopters delivering online purchases is that autonomous vehicles tend not to perform well under pressure a system that can flawlessly parallel park at mph may have trouble avoiding obstacles at mph part of the problem is the time it takes to produce and interpret camera data an autonomous vehicle using a standard camera to monitor its surroundings might take about a fifth of a second to update its location that s good enough for normal operating conditions but not nearly fast enough to handle the unexpected andrea censi a research scientist in mit s laboratory for information and decision systems thinks the solution could be to supplement cameras with a new type of sensor called an event based or neuromorphic sensor which can take measurements a million times a second at this year s international conference on robotics and automation censi and davide scaramuzza of the university of zurich present the first state estimation algorithm the type of algorithm robots use to gauge their position to process data from event based sensors a robot running their algorithm could update its location every thousandth of a second or so allowing it to perform much more nimble maneuvers in a regular camera you have an array of sensors and then there is a clock censi explains if you have a frames per second camera every milliseconds the clock freezes all the values and then the values are read in order with an event based sensor by contrast each pixel acts as an independent sensor censi says when a change in luminance in either the plus or minus direction is larger than a threshold the pixel says i see something interesting and communicates this information as an event and then it waits until it sees another change featured event when a standard state estimation algorithm receives an image from a robot mounted camera it first identifies features gradations of color or shade that it takes to be boundaries between objects then it selects a subset of those features that it considers unlikely to change much with new perspectives thirty milliseconds later when the camera fires again the algorithm performs the same type of analysis and starts trying to match features between the two images this is a trial and error process which can take anywhere from to milliseconds depending on how dramatically the scene has changed once it s matched features the algorithm can deduce from their changes in position how far the robot has moved censi and scaramuzza s algorithm supplements camera data with events reported by an event based sensor which was designed by their collaborator tobi delbruck of the institute for neuroinformatics in zurich the new algorithm s first advantage is that it doesn t have to identify features every event is intrinsically a change in luminance which is what defines a feature and because the events are reported so rapidly every millionth of a second the matching problem becomes much simpler there aren t as many candidate features to consider because the robot can t have moved very far moreover the algorithm doesn t try to match all the features in an image at once for each event it generates a set of hypotheses about how far the robot has moved corresponding to several candidate features after enough events have accumulated it simply selects the hypothesis that turns up most frequently in experiments involving a robot with a camera and an event based sensor mounted on it their algorithm proved just as accurate as existing state estimation algorithms getting onboard one of the inspirations for the new work censi says was a series of recent experiments by vijay kumar at the university of pennsylvania which demonstrated that quadrotor helicopters robotic helicopters with four sets of rotors could perform remarkably nimble maneuvers but in those experiments kumar gauged the robots location using a battery of external cameras that captured exposures a second censi believes that his and scaramuzza s algorithm would allow a quadrotor with onboard sensors to replicate kumar s results now that he and his colleagues have a reliable state estimation algorithm censi says the next step is to develop a corresponding control algorithm an algorithm that decides what to do on the basis of the state estimates that s the subject of an ongoing collaboration with emilio frazzoli a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at mit this work is very interesting says roland siegwart a professor of autonomous systems at the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich it is to my knowledge the first time such a neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor dvs has been integrated and evaluated on a mobile robot platform the dvs offers a novel type of sensing modality with very high bandwidth siegwart continues this has quite some potential for specific high speed robot motions such as dynamic maneuvers with quadrotors with only on board perception and control but whether neuromorphic sensors will prove the most practical means of doing odometry remains to be seen he cautions i have some doubts if a combination of a dvs with a standard camera can outperform in quality and price a system that tightly integrates

lids researchers apply principles of control theory to measure software robustnessshare march researchers in the laboratory for information and decision systems lids working with a colleague at georgia tech have shown in a paper titled optimization of lyapunov invariants in verification of software systems in the latest issue of the journal ieee transactions on automatic control that principles from control theory can be applied to computer software to improve software verification principal author mardavij roozbehani and mit professor of electrical engineering alexandre megretski and eric feron a professor of aerospace software engineering at georgia tech have designed a way to measure robustness of software an approach to software design that is new and shows potential their work has explored control theory which in its simplest level can be compared with a pendulum image left the oscillation of a pendulum offers the simplest example of a lyapunov function a central concept in control theory the pendulum s loss of energy with each swing guarantees that it won t lurch into a less stable state courtesy mit news office read more in the mit news office march article by larry hardesty titled can control theory make software better techniques used to ensure that airplanes won t stall out in flight could be adapted to prove that computer programs won t divide by zero posted in its entirety below formal verification is a set of methods for mathematically proving that a computer program does what it s supposed to do it s universal in hardware design and in the development of critical control software that can t tolerate bugs it s common in academic research and it s beginning to make inroads in commercial software in the latest issue of the journal ieee transactions on automatic control researchers from mit s laboratory for information and decision systems lids and a colleague at georgia tech show how to apply principles from control theory which analyzes dynamical systems ranging from robots to power grids to formal verification the result could help computer scientists expand their repertoire of formal verification techniques and it could be particularly useful in the area of approximate computation in which designers of computer systems trade a little bit of computational accuracy for large gains in speed or power efficiency in particular the researchers adapted something called a lyapunov function which is a mainstay of control theory the graph of a standard lyapunov function slopes everywhere toward its minimum value it can be thought of as looking kind of like a bowl if the function characterizes the dynamics of a physical system and the minimum value represents a stable state of the system then the curve of the graph guarantees that the system will move toward greater stability the most basic example of a lyapunov function is a pendulum swinging and its energy decaying says mardavij roozbehani a principal research scientist in lids and lead author on the new paper this decay of energy becomes a certificate of stability or good behavior of the pendulum system of course most dynamical systems are more complex than pendulums and finding lyapunov functions that characterize them can be difficult but there s a large literature on lyapunov functions in control theory and roozbehani and his colleagues are hopeful that much of it will prove applicable to software verification skirting dangers in their new paper roozbehani and his coauthors mit professor of electrical engineering alexandre megretski and eric feron a professor of aerospace software engineering at georgia tech envision a computer program as a set of rules for navigating a space defined by the variables in the program and the memory locations of the program instructions any state of the program any values for the variables during execution of a particular instruction constitutes a point in that space problems with a program s execution such as dividing by zero or overloading the memory can be thought of as regions in the space in practice finding a lyapunov invariant with the desired properties means systematically investigating different classes of functions there s no general way to predict in advance what type of function it will be or even that it exists but roozbehani imagines that if his and his colleagues approach catches on researchers will begin to identify algorithms that lend themselves to particular types of lyapunov invariants as has happened with control problems and lyapunov functions fuzzy thinking moreover many of the critical software systems that require formal verification implement control systems designed using lyapunov functions so there are intuitive reasons to believe that at least for control system software these methods will work well roozbehani says roozbehani is also enthusiastic about possible applications in approximate computation as he explains many control systems are based on mathematical models that can t capture all of the complexity of real dynamical systems so control theorists have developed analytic methods that can account for model inaccuracies and provide guarantees of stability even in the presence of uncertainty those techniques roozbehani argues could be perfectly suited for verifying code that exploits approximate computation computer scientists are not used to thinking about robustness of software says george pappas chair of the department of electrical and systems engineering at the university of pennsylvania this is the first work that is formalizing the notion of robustness for software it s a paradigm shift from the more exhaustive combinatorial view of checking for bugs in software to a view where you try to see how

parsing what s in an action a new algorithm to find sub actions of interestshare may postdoctoral associate in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail hamed pirsiavash has developed a new algorithm that offers significant improvements in parsing video linearly no matter the length with fixed requirement for memory and reaching conclusions in search more efficiently the work which is based on principles of natural language processing is being presented at the conference on computer vision and pattern recognition in june pirsiavash is a member of eecs professor antonio torralba s laboratory in csail read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled who did what techniques from natural language processing enable computers to efficiently search video for actions also posted below with the commodification of digital cameras digital video has become so easy to produce that human beings can have trouble keeping up with it among the tools that computer scientists are developing to make the profusion of video more useful are algorithms for activity recognition or determining what the people on camera are doing when at the conference on computer vision and pattern recognition in june hamed pirsiavash a postdoc at mit and his former thesis advisor deva ramanan of the university of california at irvine will present a new activity recognition algorithm that has several advantages over its predecessors one is that the algorithm s execution time scales linearly with the size of the video file it s searching that means that if one file is times the size of another the new algorithm will take times as long to search it not times as long as some earlier algorithms would another is that the algorithm is able to make good guesses about partially completed actions so it can handle streaming video partway through an action it will issue a probability that the action is of the type that it s looking for it may revise that probability as the video continues but it doesn t have to wait until the action is complete to assess it finally the amount of memory the algorithm requires is fixed regardless of how many frames of video it s already reviewed that means that unlike many of its predecessors it can handle video streams of any length or files of any size the grammar of action enabling all of these advances is the appropriation of a type of algorithm used in natural language processing the computer science discipline that seeks techniques for interpreting sentences written in natural language one of the challenging problems they try to solve is if you have a sentence you want to basically parse the sentence saying what is the subject what is the verb what is the adverb pirsiavash says we see an analogy here which is if you have a complex action like making tea or making coffee that has some subactions we can basically stitch together these subactions and look at each one as something like verb adjective and adverb on that analogy the rules defining relationships between subactions are like rules of grammar when you make tea for instance it doesn t matter whether you first put the teabag in the cup or put the kettle on the stove but it s essential that you put the kettle on the stove before pouring the water into the cup similarly in a given language it could be the case that nouns can either precede or follow verbs but that adjectives must always precede nouns for any given action pirsiavash and ramanan s algorithm must thus learn a new grammar and the mechanism that it uses is the one that many natural language processing systems rely on machine learning pirsiavash and ramanan feed their algorithm training examples of videos depicting a particular action and specify the number of subactions that the algorithm should look for but they don t give it any information about what those subactions are or what the transitions between them look like pruning possibilities the rules relating subactions are the key to the algorithm s efficiency as a video plays the algorithm constructs a set of hypotheses about which subactions are being depicted where and it ranks them according to probability it can t limit itself to a single hypothesis as each new frame could require it to revise its probabilities but it can eliminate hypotheses that don t conform to its grammatical rules which dramatically limits the number of possibilities it has to canvass the researchers tested their algorithm on eight different types of athletic endeavor such as weightlifting and bowling with training videos culled from youtube they found that according to metrics standard in the field of computer vision their algorithm identified new instances of the same activities more accurately than its predecessors pirsiavash is particularly interested in possible medical applications of action detection the proper execution of physical therapy exercises for instance could have a grammar that s distinct from improper execution similarly the return of motor function in patients with neurological damage could be identified by its unique grammar action detection algorithms could also help determine whether for instance elderly patients remembered to take their medication and issue alerts if they didn t we ve known for a very long time that the things that people do are made up of subactivities says david forsyth a professor of computer science at the university of illinois at urbana champaign the problem is we don t know what the pieces are and nobody has given us labeled training data saying there are two pieces in a dive and seven pieces in a weightlifting and pieces in a hammer throw and these are their names what we need is methods that can look at a whole bunch of examples of say weightlifting and say well this piece occurs again

when he was in elementary school scott aaronson like many mathematically precocious kids of his generation dreamed of making his own video games he had only the foggiest notion of what that entailed however i could try to imagine making my own game i could draw a picture of what it should look like but how does it come to life aaronson recalls maybe there s some factory where they do all kinds of complicated machining to make mario move around in the right way then a friend showed me this spaceship game that he had on his computer and he said here s the code well what is this some kind of summary of the game no no this is the game if you change the code the spaceship will do something different i like to say that for me this was like learning where babies came from aaronson adds it was a revelation and i was incredibly upset at my parents that they hadn t told me earlier that this exists because i was already and other kids had known programming since they were and how would i ever catch up to them as that anecdote attests aaronson was a young man in a hurry also at he taught himself calculus because he was intrigued by the mysterious symbols in a babysitter s calculus textbook the next year when aaronson s father a science writer turned public relations executive was transferred from philadelphia to hong kong to spearhead a new marketing push by at t aaronson enrolled in an english language school that offered him the opportunity to skip a grade and leap several years ahead in math when he returned to the united states as a high school freshman however aaronson chafed at what he saw as the constricting dogmas of public education getting poor grades and butting heads with teachers so he enrolled in a yearlong program for gifted high school students at clarkson university and that winter applied to colleges in what would have been his junior year of high school and over his mother s objection that he d have trouble fitting in socially he entered cornell university as a freshman theoretical attraction despite this accelerated trajectory however he never lost the sense that as a programmer he still lagged behind his peers at cornell he was part of a team of undergraduates who wrote control algorithms for robots competing in the robocup robotic soccer tournament we won for two years not thanks to me at all aaronson says i loved the mathematical part but when it comes to software development when it comes to making your code work with other people s code and documenting code and meeting deadlines other people were just going to be so much better at this than i was the summer before his year at clarkson aaronson had attended a math camp in seattle where he had learned about the p np problem the central problem in computer science from one of its most prominent theorists richard karp p is a set of problems that can be solved relatively quickly and np is a set of problems whose solutions can be verified relatively quickly for many problems in np however notably those known as np complete finding solutions appears to be a prohibitively time consuming task most mathematicians believe that p does not equal np that being easy to verify doesn t make a problem easy to solve but nobody s been able to prove it when he was working with the robocup team aaronson says someone would mention offhandedly that we want the goalie to be able to move this way and i d start thinking about whether that s np complete and maybe two weeks later i d be able to prove that it s np complete but by then no one cares anyway they ve moved on to a different way of doing it already intrigued by theoretical questions of computational complexity aaronson learned from a fellow cornell student about shor s algorithm perhaps the most important theoretical result in quantum computing quantum computers are devices still largely hypothetical that would harness the strange behavior of matter at extremely small scales to perform computations discovered by peter shor in shor s algorithm is a quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers one of the canonical np problems that is easy to verify but apparently very hard to solve shockingly shor was able to show that for a quantum computer solving the problem would be almost as easy as verifying it is for a classical computer my first reaction was ok this is probably some obvious crap that is getting hyped by the media aaronson says but he had to know for sure and he threw himself into the study of quantum computing he came away convinced that indeed quantum computers would rewrite the rules of computational efficiency quantum complex the relationship between complexity the classification of algorithms according to their execution time and quantum physics has remained at the center of aaronson s research since he did his graduate work

algorithm that betters his and prof dina katabi s work to develop a faster than fast fourier transform in the new algorithm that uses the minimum possible number of samples to analyze signals has the potential to allow advances in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr machines to scan patients read more in the dec mit news office article by helen knight titled leaner fourier transforms new algorithm can separate signals into their individual frequencies using a minimal number of samples also posted below image credit christine daniloff mit news office the fast fourier transform one of the most important algorithms of the th century revolutionized signal processing the algorithm allowed computers to quickly perform fourier transforms fundamental operations that separate signals into their individual frequencies leading to developments in audio and video engineering and digital data compression but ever since its development in the s computer scientists have been searching for an algorithm to better it last year mit researchers piotr indyk and dina katabi did just that unveiling an algorithm that in some circumstances can perform fourier transforms hundreds of times more quickly than the fast fourier transform fft now indyk a professor of computer science and engineering and a member of the theory of computation group within the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail and his team have gone a step further significantly reducing the number of samples that must be taken from a given signal in order to perform a fourier transform operation close to theoretical minimum in a paper to be presented at the acm siam symposium on discrete algorithms in january indyk postdoc michael kapralov and former student eric price will reveal an algorithm that can perform fourier transforms using close to the theoretical minimum number of samples they have also bettered even this developing an algorithm that uses the minimum possible number of signal samples this could significantly reduce the time it takes medical devices such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr machines to scan patients or allow astronomers to take more detailed images of the universe indyk says the fourier transform is a fundamental mathematical notion that allows signals to be broken down into their component parts when you listen to someone speak for example you can hear a dominant tone which is the principal frequency in their voice but there are many other underlying frequencies which is why the human voice is not a single tone it s much richer than that indyk says so in order to understand what the spectrum looks like we need to decompose the sounds into their basic frequencies and that is exactly what the fourier transform does the development of the fft automated this process for the first time allowing computers to rapidly manipulate and compress digital signals into a more manageable form this is possible because not all of the frequencies within a digital signal are equal indeed in nature many signals contain just a few dominant frequencies and a number of far less important ones which can be safely disregarded these are known as sparse signals in real life often when you look at a signal there are only a small number of frequencies that dominate the spectrum indyk says so we can compress the signal by keeping only the top percent of these indyk and katabi s previous work focused on the length of time their algorithm needed to perform a sparse fourier transform operation however in many applications the number of samples the algorithm must take of the signal can be as important as its running time applications in medical imaging astronomy one such example is in mri scanning indyk says the device acquires fourier samples basically snapshots of the body lying inside the machine which it uses to recover the inner structure of the body he says in this situation the number of samples taken is directly proportionate to the amount of time that the patient has to spend in the machine so by allowing the mri scanner to produce an image of the body using a fraction of the samples needed by existing devices it could significantly reduce the time patients must spend lying still inside the narrow noisy machines the team is also investigating the idea of using the new sparse fourier transform algorithm in astronomy they are working with researchers at the mit haystack observatory who specialize in radio astronomy to use the system in interferometry in which signals from an array of telescopes are combined to produce a single high resolution image of space applying the sparse fourier transform algorithm to the telescope signals would reduce the number of observations needed to produce an image of the same quality indyk says that s important he says because these are really massive data sets and to make matters worse much of this data is distributed because there are several different separated telescopes and each of them acquires some of the information and then it all has to be sent to the same place to be processed what s more radio telescopes are extremely expensive to build so an algorithm that allows astronomers to use fewer of them or to obtain better quality images from the same number of sensors could be extremely important he says martin strauss a professor of mathematics electrical engineering and computer science at the university of michigan who develops fundamental algorithms for applications such as signal processing and massive data sets says work by indyk and others makes sparse fourier transform algorithms advantageous over the celebrated fft on a larger class of problems

succinct zero knowledge proof for arbitrary programs at the international cryptology conference in august read more in the sept mit news office article by larry hardesty titled detecting program tampering in the cloud a new version of zero knowledge proofs allows cloud customers to verify the proper execution of their software with a single packet of data also posted below graphic courtesy christine daniloff mit news office for small and midsize organizations the outsourcing of demanding computational tasks to the cloud huge banks of computers accessible over the internet can be much more cost effective than buying their own hardware but it also poses a security risk a malicious hacker could rent space on a cloud server and use it to launch programs that hijack legitimate applications interfering with their execution in august at the international cryptology conference researchers from mit and israel s technion and tel aviv university presented a new system that can quickly verify that a program running on the cloud is executing properly that amounts to a guarantee that no malicious code is interfering with the program s execution the same system also protects the data used by applications running in the cloud cryptographically ensuring that the user won t learn anything other than the immediate results of the requested computation if for instance hospitals were pooling medical data in a huge database hosted on the cloud researchers could look for patterns in the data without compromising patient privacy although the paper reports new theoretical results view pdf the researchers have also built working code that implements their system at present it works only with programs written in the c programming language but adapting it to other languages should be straightforward the new work like much current research on secure computation requires that computer programs be represented as circuits so the researchers system includes a circuit generator that automatically converts c code to circuit diagrams the circuits it produces however are much smaller than those produced by its predecessors so by itself the circuit generator may find other applications in cryptography zero knowledge alessandro chiesa a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science at mit and one of the paper s authors says that because the new system protects both the integrity of programs running in the cloud and the data they use it s a good complement to the cryptographic technique known as homomorphic encryption which protects the data transmitted by the users of cloud applications joining chiesa on the paper are madars virza also a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science the technion s daniel genkin and eli ben sasson who was a visiting professor at mit for the past two years and tel aviv university s eran tromer who was a postdoc at mit the researchers system implements a so called zero knowledge proof a type of mathematical game invented by mit professors shafi goldwasser and silvio micali and their colleague charles rackoff of the university of toronto in its cryptographic application a zero knowledge proof enables one of the game s players to prove to the other that he or she knows a secret key without actually divulging it but as its name implies a zero knowledge proof is a more general method for proving mathematical theorems and the correct execution of a computer program can be redescribed as a theorem so zero knowledge proofs are by definition able to establish whether or not a computer program is executing correctly the problem is that existing implementations of zero knowledge proofs except in cases where they ve been tailored to particular algorithms take as long to execute as the programs they re trying to verify that s fine for password verification but not for a computation substantial enough that it might be farmed out to the cloud the researchers innovation is a practical succinct zero knowledge proof for arbitrary programs indeed it s so succinct that it can typically fit in a single data packet linear thinking as chiesa explains his and his colleagues approach depends on a variation of what s known as a probabilistically checkable proof or pcp with a standard mathematical proof if you want to verify it you have to go line by line from the start to the end chiesa says if you were to skip one line potentially that could fool you traditional proofs are very fragile in this respect the pcp theorem says that there is a way to rewrite proofs so that instead of reading them line by line chiesa adds what you can do is flip a few coins and probabilistically sample three or four lines and have a probabilistic guarantee that it s correct the problem virza says is that the current known constructions of the pcp theorem though great in theory have quite bad practical realizations that s because the theory assumes that an adversary who s trying to produce a fraudulent proof has unbounded computational capacity what chiesa virza and their colleagues do instead is assume that the adversary is capable only of performing simple linear operations this assumption is of course false in practice virza says so we use a cryptographic encoding to force the adversary to only linear evaluations there is a way to encode numbers into such a form that you can add those numbers but you can t do anything else this is how we sidestep the inefficiencies of the pcp theorem i think it s a breakthrough

distributed computing read more in the aug mit news office article by larry hardesty titled reliable communication unreliable networks a new model of wireless networks that better represents the real world could lead to more robust communications protocols posted below now that the internet s basic protocols are more than years old network scientists are increasingly turning their attention to ad hoc networks communications networks set up on the fly by wireless devices where unsolved problems still abound most theoretical analyses of ad hoc networks have assumed that the communications links within the network are stable but that often isn t the case with real world wireless devices as anyone who s used a cellphone knows at the association for computing machinery s symposium on principles of distributed computing in july past and present researchers from the theory of distributed systems group at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory presented a new framework for analyzing ad hoc networks in which the quality of the communications links fluctuates within that framework they provide mathematical bounds on the efficiency with which messages can propagate through the network and they describe new algorithms that can achieve maximal efficiency there s been a discrepancy between the theory with its idealized models and the reality of wireless networks says nancy lynch the nec professor of software science and engineering at mit and head of the theory of distributed systems group when people start designing theoretical algorithms they tend to rely too heavily on the specific assumptions of the models so the algorithms tend to be unrealistic and fragile in the past some researchers have tried to model the unreliability of network links as random fluctuations but if you assume real randomness then you can count on the randomness lynch says somehow you can use that in your algorithm maybe randomness itself is giving you an assumption that s too strong adversarial relationships so lynch and her coauthors on the new paper mohsen ghaffari a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and cal newport a former graduate student in lynch s group who s now an assistant professor of computer science at georgetown university instead modeled the fluctuations in the links quality as the willful manipulations of an adversary the adversary can t control all the links in the network some will remain up throughout the execution of the communication algorithm but he can change the bandwidth of the others at will and the network designer doesn t know in advance which links are reliable and which aren t your algorithm needs to work for all possible adversaries some of which are benign and some of which might be doing the worst possible thing for your algorithm newport says in other words it needs to work for all possible strategies for controlling the network in a paper that appeared two years ago newport lynch and colleagues assumed a very powerful adversary indeed one that knew in advance every decision that every node in the network would make while trying to disseminate a message in that context they proved efficient communication is impossible in the new paper they weakened the adversary significantly he may know exactly how the communications algorithm works and he may intentionally try to thwart it but he has to determine his pattern of link manipulation in advance before the algorithm begins to run even this weakened adversary however has the potential to be much more disruptive than the types of interference that real world wireless networks are likely to encounter such as doors opening and closing people turning on microwaves or rain falling lynch newport and ghaffari examined two types of message dissemination in the first a single node of the network is trying to broadcast a message to all other nodes in that case they found efficient communication is possible even in the adversary s presence geometrical supposition the second case is that in which a number of nodes are each transmitting messages and every one of their immediate neighbors has to receive a message from at least one transmitter as it turns out many common problems in the analysis of ad hoc networks boil down to this one here the researchers found that the adversary s presence can thwart efficient communication but only if the network has an odd shape in which a central node is connected to many nearby nodes that aren t connected to each other that type of network layout is improbable in the real world if two wireless devices are close enough to a third to communicate with it they re likely to be able to communicate with each other too once the researchers added another assumption that two devices connected to a third will at least sometimes be able to establish links with each other too efficient communication again becomes possible in both cases the researchers communication algorithms were able to thwart the adversary by using randomness one of the problems with designing communications protocols for ad hoc wireless networks is that if two nearby nodes begin transmitting at the same time at the same frequency they can interfere with each other preventing either transmission from being received the best performing protocols thus assign each node a probability of transmitting during any one round of communication where a

solves a major problem with homomorphic encryption which would let web servers process data without decrypting it posted below in its entirety homomorphic encryption is one of the most exciting new research topics in cryptography which promises to make cloud computing perfectly secure with it a web user would send encrypted data to a server in the cloud which would process it without decrypting it and send back a still encrypted result sometimes however the server needs to know something about the data it s handling otherwise some computational tasks become prohibitively time consuming if not outright impossible suppose for instance that the task you ve outsourced to the cloud is to search a huge encrypted database for the handful of records that match an encrypted search term homomorphic encryption ensures that the server has no idea what the search term is or which records match it as a consequence however it has no choice but to send back information on every record in the database the user s computer can decrypt that information to see which records matched and which didn t but then it s assuming much of the computational burden that it was trying to offload to the

both of whom did their graduate work at mit with goldwasser near misses the researchers built their functional encryption scheme by fitting together several existing schemes each of which has vital attributes of functional encryption but none of which is entirely sufficient in itself the first of those is homomorphic encryption another is what s known as a garbled circuit a technique developed in the mid s and widely used in cryptography a garbled circuit lets a user decrypt the result of one cryptographically protected operation on one cryptographically protected data item say is this record a match the problem is that if the garbled circuit is used on a second data item how about this record the security breaks moreover a garbled circuit is a so called private key system in which only the holder of a secret cryptographic key can encrypt data homomorphic encryption by contrast is intended as a public key system like most of the encryption schemes used to protect financial transactions on the web with public key encryption anyone can encrypt a message using a key that s published online but only the holder of the secret key can decrypt it the final component technique is called attribute based encryption attribute based encryption is a public key system and it s reusable but unlike garbled circuits and homomorphic encryption it can t reveal the output of a function without revealing the input too the new system begins with homomorphic encryption and embeds the decryption algorithm in a garbled circuit the key to the garbled circuit in turn is protected by attribute based encryption in some sense the garbled circuit can like all garbled circuits be used only once but the encryption schemes are layered in such a way that one use grants the server access to a general function rather than a single value it can thus ask of every record in a database is this a match zeldovich points out that since the scheme relies on homomorphic encryption it shares the major drawback of existing homomorphic schemes they re still too computationally intensive to be practical on the other hand he says it s

turing award for their fundamental contributions to the field of provable security their work has had a major impact on a broad spectrum of applications touching everyday lives and has opened exciting new research opportunities says anantha chandrakasan head of mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs this is a tremendous honor for the eecs department and inspiring for the large number of students and faculty who have benefited from interactions with shafi and silvio goldwasser and micali began collaborating as graduate students at the university of california at berkeley in while toying around with the idea of how to securely play a game of poker over the phone they devised a scheme for encrypting and ensuring the security of single bits of data from there goldwasser and micali proved that their scheme could be scaled up to tackle much more complex problems such as communications protocols and internet transactions based on their work goldwasser and micali published a paper in titled probabilistic encryption which laid the framework for modern cryptography in the paper they introduced formal security definitions which remain the gold standard for security to this day and pioneered randomized methods for encryption goldwasser and micali proved that encryption schemes must be randomized rather than deterministic with many possible encrypted texts corresponding to each message a development that revolutionized the study of cryptography and laid the foundation for the theory of cryptographic security they also introduced the simulation paradigm which demonstrates a system s security by showing that an enemy could have simulated all the information he obtained during the employment of a cryptographic system proving that the cryptographic system poses no risk the simulation paradigm has become the most widely used method for enabling security in cryptography going beyond privacy to address problems in authentication and integrity of data software protection and protocols that involve many participants such as electronic elections and auctions one of goldwasser and micali s most significant contributions is their paper with charles rackoff titled the knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems it introduced knowledge complexity a concept that deals with hiding information from an adversary and is a quantifiable measure of how much useful information could be extracted the paper initiated the idea of zero knowledge proofs in which interaction the ability of provers and verifiers to send each other messages back and forth and probabilism the ability to toss coins to decide which messages to send enable the establishment of a fact via a statistical argument without providing any additional information as to why it is true zero knowledge proofs were a striking new philosophical idea that provided the essential language for speaking about security of cryptographic protocols by controlling the leakage of knowledge subsequent works by oded goldreich micali and avi wigderson and by michael benor goldwasser and wigderson showed that every multiparty computation could be carried out securely revealing to the players no more knowledge than prescribed by the desired outcome these papers exhibited the power and utility of zero knowledge protocols and demonstrated their ubiquitous and omnipotent character the paper identified interactive proofs as a new method to verify correctness in the exchange of information beyond cryptography interactive proofs can be verified much faster than classical proofs and can be used in practice to guarantee correctness in a variety of applications such as cloud computing in a series of works by goldwasser micali and other collaborators interactive proofs have been extended in several new directions one direction was to include interactions between a single verifier and multiple provers which has led to a new way to define and prove np completeness for approximation problems an area of active research another led to the development of computationally sound proofs which can be easily compacted and verified allowing for expedient accuracy checks i am very proud to have won the turing award goldwasser says our work was very unconventional at the time we were graduate students and let our imagination run free from using

be presented in may this spring at the international conference on the theory and applications of cryptographic techniques read more in the feb mit news office article by larry hardesty titled beefing up public key encryption mit researchers show how to secure widely used encryption schemes against attackers who have intercepted examples of successful decryption posted below most financial transactions on the internet are safeguarded by a cryptographic technique called public key encryption where traditional encryption relies on a single secret key shared by both sender and recipient public key encryption uses two keys that are mathematically related one the public key is published on the internet and any sender can use it to encrypt a message the second the private key is known only to the recipient and is required for decryption standard public key encryption is secure as long as an attacker knows nothing other than the public key but financial institutions and other large organizations seek security against more sophisticated attacks called chosen ciphertext attacks ccas in which the attacker also has examples of successful decryption unfortunately public key encryption schemes that are resilient against ccas are hard to devise their complexity means that software implementations are prone to small errors that can introduce both vulnerabilities and inaccuracies during decryption at the international conference on the theory and applications of cryptographic techniques this spring a pair of postdocs at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory describe a new technique for taking one of these vulnerable error prone cca schemes and turning it into a secure cca scheme the result could be of practical use in the development of more secure encryption protocols but it could also provide theoretical insight into the very nature of cryptographic security playing the odds in cryptography circles a message to be encoded is called a plaintext the encrypted version of it is called a ciphertext an encryption scheme is considered secure if even someone who knows two plaintexts in advance would find it virtually impossible to deduce which of two ciphertexts encodes which in the type of weak cca schemes that the mit researchers huijia lin and stefano tessaro consider the probability of distinguishing the ciphertexts is non negligible it may not be very big but it s big enough to be a cause for concern similarly there s also a non negligible probability of errors during decryption lin and tessaro s result hinges on the observation that while in the average case the probability of distinguishing weakly encrypted ciphertexts may be unacceptably high in some particular cases it s negligible moreover it s possible to compute the probability that the encrypted version of a randomly generated plaintext will be secure as it happens combining a weakly encrypted ciphertext with a strongly encrypted one produces a strongly encrypted hybrid in essence lin and tessaro s scheme entails encrypting enough random plaintexts that probabilistically at least a few of them will be secure then they re all combined lin and tessaro s technique doesn t just secure transmissions against attackers who have some examples of successful decryption it secures them against adversaries who have a black box that without disclosing the secret key can decrypt any ciphertext they feed it except the one that s under attack in real life maybe it seems more plausible that people would just get a couple of examples of ciphertexts and messages but as cryptographers we always want to prevent the worst possible scenario lin says even if we want to handle the case where you just have examples of ciphertexts and the messages it s hard to exhaust all possible scenarios by considering the strongest attack we automatically become immune to all possible scenarios which are hard to enumerate the question they ask how to improve the security of vulnerable encryption schemes is a very natural and intriguing one says abhi shalat an assistant professor of computer science at the university of virginia who studies encryption and the techniques that they use to show that demonstrate a lot of creativity and elegance in information theory shalat says it s well established that if you and i are trying to communicate and we have a slightly better chance of less noise than the adversary has you can sort of amplify that advantage so that we can actually talk privately but that technique doesn t necessarily work when the adversary is adaptive when the adversary can query a black box decryption oracle and be actively malicious as is the case with encryption on the internet shalat says one of the really nice ideas in the paper is the extension of this information amplification idea to this adaptive setting mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

towards practical compressed sensing renewed focus on theory and practiceshare february trying to build a new circuit that would use an emerging technology called compressed sensing has taken on a renewed focus under the work of members of the electrical engineering and computer science department at mit including lead researcher eecs graduate student omid abari working with researchers in the research laboratory of electronics at mit rle and in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail obari is seeking to balance theory with chip building realities using new evaluation algorithms to allow creation of the ideal circuit read more in the feb mit news office article by larry hardesty titled toward practical compressed sensing researchers show how the vagaries of real world circuitry affect the performance of a promising new technique in signal processing and imaging posted below the last years have seen a flurry of research on an emerging technology called compressed sensing compressed sensing does something that seems miraculous it extracts more information from a signal than the signal would appear to contain one of the most celebrated demonstrations of the technology came in when rice university researchers produced images with a resolution of tens of thousands of pixels using a camera whose sensor had only one pixel compressed sensing promises dramatic reductions in the cost and power consumption of a wide range of imaging and signal processing applications but it s been slow to catch on commercially in part because of a general skepticism that sophisticated math ever works as well in practice as it does in theory researchers at mit s research laboratory of electronics rle hope to change that with a new mathematical framework for evaluating compressed sensing schemes that factors in the real world performance of hardware components the people who are working on the theory side make some assumptions that circuits are ideal when in reality they are not says omid abari a doctoral student in the department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs who led the new work on the other hand it s very costly to build a circuit in terms of time and also money so this work is a bridge between these two worlds theory people could improve algorithms by considering circuit nonidealities and the people who are building a chip could use this framework and methodology to evaluate the performance of those algorithms or systems and if they see their potential they can build a circuit mixed reviews in a series of recent papers four members of associate professor vladimir stojanovic s integrated systems group at rle abari stojanovic postdoc fabian lim and recent graduate fred chen applied their methodology to two applications where compressed sensing appeared to promise significant power savings the first was spectrum sensing in which wireless devices would scan the airwaves to detect unused frequencies that they could use to increase their data rates the second was the transmission of data from wireless sensors such as electrocardiogram ekg leads to wired base stations at last year s international conference on acoustics speech and signal processing the researchers showed that alas in spectrum detection compressed sensing can provide only a relatively coarse grained picture of spectrum allocation even then the power savings are fairly meager but in other work they argue that encoding data from wireless sensors may be a more natural application of the technique in a forthcoming paper in the journal ieee transactions on circuits and systems they show that indeed in the case of ekg monitoring it can provide a percent reduction in the power consumed by battery powered wireless leads the reason the rice camera could get away with a single pixel sensor is that before striking the sensor incoming light the optical signal bounced off an array of micromirrors some of which were tilted to reflect the signal and some of which weren t the pattern of on and off mirrors was random and changed hundreds or even thousands of times and the sensor measured the corresponding changes in total light intensity software could then use information about the sequence of patterns to reconstruct the original signal ups and downs the applications the rle researchers investigated do something similar but rather than using mirrors to modify a signal they use another signal one that alternates between two values high and low in a random pattern in the case of spectrum sensing the frequency of the input signal is so high that mixing it with the second signal eats up much of the power savings that compressed sensing affords moreover the time intervals during which the second signal is high or low should be of precisely equal duration and the transition from high to low or vice versa should be instantaneous in practice neither is true and the result is the steady accumulation of tiny errors that in aggregate diminish the precision with which occupied frequencies can be identified an ekg signal however is mostly silence punctuated by spikes every second or so when the heart contracts as a consequence the circuitry that mixes it with the second signal can operate at a much lower frequency so it consumes less power abari however says he hasn t given up on applying compressed sensing to spectrum sensing a new algorithm called the sparse fast fourier transform developed at mit would modify the signal in the spectrum sensing application in a way that offsets both the loss of resolution and the increase in power consumption abari is currently working with eecs professor dina katabi one of the new algorithm s inventors to build a chip that implements that algorithm and could be integrated into future compressed sensing systems mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

three days in december four research groups announced progress on a quantum computing proposal made two years ago by mit researchers posted below in early a pair of theoretical computer scientists at mit proposed an optical experiment that would harness the weird laws of quantum mechanics to perform a computation impossible on conventional computers commenting at the time a quantum computing researcher at imperial college london said that the experiment has the potential to take us past what i would like to call the quantum singularity where we do the first thing quantumly that we can t do on a classical computer the experiment involves generating individual photons particles of light and synchronizing their passage through a maze of optical components so that they reach a battery of photon detectors at the same time the mit researchers scott aaronson an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and his student alex arkhipov believed that difficult as their experiment may be to perform it could prove easier than building a fully functional quantum computer in december four different groups of experimental physicists centered at the university of queensland the university of vienna the university of oxford and polytechnic university of milan reported the completion of rudimentary versions of aaronson and arkhipov s experiment papers by two of the groups appeared back to back in the journal science the other two papers are as yet unpublished all four papers however appeared on arxiv an online compendium of research papers within a span of three days aaronson is a co author on the paper from queensland as is justin dove a graduate student in the department of electrical engineering and computer science and a member of mit s optical and quantum communications group changing channels the original formulation of aaronson and arkhipov s experiment proposed a network of beam splitters optical devices that are ordinarily used to split an optical signal in half and route it down separate fibers in practice most of the groups to post papers on arxiv those other than the queensland group built their networks on individual chips using channels known as waveguides to route the photons where two waveguides come close enough together a photon can spontaneously leap from one to the other mimicking the behavior caused by a beam splitter performing a calculation impossible on a conventional computer would require a network of hundreds of beam splitters with dozens of channels leading both in and out a few dozen photons would be fired into the network over a random subset of the channels photodetectors would record where they come out that process would have to be repeated thousands of times the groups posting papers on arxiv used networks of or so beam splitters with four or five channels leading in and three or four photons so their work constitutes a proof of principle not yet the quantum singularity the computation that aaronson and arkhipov s experiment performs is obscure and not very useful technically it samples from a probability distribution defined by permanents of large matrices there are however proposals to use optical signals to do general purpose quantum computing most prominently a scheme known as klm after its creators emanuel knill raymond laflamme and gerard milburn according to dove some in the quantum computing community have suggested that aaronson and arkhipov s experiment may be difficult enough to perform with the requisite number of photons that researchers would be better off trying to build full fledged klm systems but dove says one of the ways that scott and i like to pitch this idea is as an intermediate step that we need to do klm building a klm optical quantum computer would entail building everything necessary to perform the aaronson arkhipov experiment plus a bunch of other perhaps even more challenging technologies you can think of scott and alex s result as saying look one of the steps to performing klm is interesting in its own right dove says so i think it s inevitable that we re going to do these experiments whether people label them that way or not mit

artificial intelligence lab csail has teamed with members of the mit center for bits and atoms to develop a new kind of robotic device that mimics nature s folding of proteins to allow for all kinds of possible functionality the tiny device pictured below named a milli motein is run by a new kind of motor an electropermanent motor to maintain the milli motein shape even with power turned off ultimately the work takes this area of research one step closer to the possibility of programmable matter read more in the nov mit news office article by david l chandler titled the robotic equivalent of a swiss army knife reconfigurable robot a step toward something that can become almost anything posted below the device a four segment milli motein chain with a one centimeter module size pictured left courtesy of the center for bits and atoms doesn t look like much a caterpillar sized assembly of metal rings and strips resembling something you might find buried in a home workshop drawer but the technology behind it and the long range possibilities it represents are quite remarkable the little device is called a milli motein a name melding its millimeter sized components and a motorized design inspired by proteins which naturally fold themselves into incredibly complex shapes this minuscule robot may be a harbinger of future devices that could fold themselves up into almost any shape imaginable the device was conceived by neil gershenfeld head of mit s center for bits and atoms visiting scientist ara knaian and postdoctoral associate kenneth cheung and is described in a paper presented recently at the intelligent robots and systems conference its key feature gershenfeld says it s effectively a one dimensional robot that can be made in a continuous strip without conventionally moving parts and then folded into arbitrary shapes to build the world s smallest chain robot the team had to invent an entirely new kind of motor not only small and strong but also able to hold its position firmly even with power switched off the researchers met these needs with a new system called an electropermanent motor the motor is similar in principle to the giant electromagnets used in scrapyards to lift cars in which a powerful permanent magnet one that like an ordinary bar magnet requires no power is paired with a weaker magnet one whose magnetic field direction can be flipped by an electric current in a coil the two magnets are designed so that their fields either add or cancel depending on which way the switchable field points thus the force of the powerful magnet can be turned off at will such as to release a suspended car without having to power an enormous electromagnet the whole time in this new miniature version a series of permanent magnets paired with electromagnets are arranged in a circle they drive a steel ring that s situated around them the key innovation knaian explains is that they do not take power in either the on or the off state but only use power in the changing state using minimal energy overall the milli motein concept follows up on a paper published last year which examined the theoretical possibility of assembling any desired d shape simply by folding a long string of identical subunits that paper co authored by cheung mit professor erik demaine alumnus saul griffith and former computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory research scientist jonathan bachrach proved mathematically that it was possible for any d shape to be reproduced by folding a sufficiently long string and that it s possible to figure out how to fold such a string and the exact steps needed to successfully reach the desired endpoint we showed that you could make such a universal system that s very simple cheung says while he and his colleagues have not yet proved a way of always finding the optimal path to a given folded shape they did find several useful strategies for arriving at practical folding sequences demaine points out that the folding of the shape doesn t have to be sequential moving along the string one joint at a time ideally you d like to do it all at once he says with each of the joints folding themselves to the desired configuration simultaneously so that the loads are distributed other researchers including some at mit have explored the idea of fashioning reconfigurable robots from a batch of separate pieces that could self assemble into different configurations an approach sometimes called programmable pebbles but gershenfeld s team found that a string of subunits capable of folding itself into any shape could be simpler in terms of control power and communications than using separate pieces that must find each other and assemble in the right order you can just pass signals down the chain knaian says it s part of an overall approach gershenfeld explains to turning data into things in an article in the current issue of the magazine foreign affairs he describes a technology roadmap for accomplishing that and its policy implications he and his colleagues have established a global network of more than fab labs that provide community access to computer controlled fabrication tools today the design information is contained in an external computer rather than in the materials being manufactured but the research goal is to digitize the materials themselves so that they can ultimately change their own shape as the milli motein does hod lipson an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and computing and information science at cornell university says this result brings us closer to the idea of programmable matter where computer programs and materials merge to

internet of things read more in the february mit news office article by larry hardesty titled radio chip for the internet of things circuit that reduces power leakage when transmitters are idle could greatly extend battery life also posted below image credit jose luis olivares mit news at this year s consumer electronics show in las vegas the big theme was the internet of things the idea that everything in the human environment from kitchen appliances to industrial equipment could be equipped with sensors and processors that can exchange data helping with maintenance and the coordination of tasks realizing that vision however requires transmitters that are powerful enough to broadcast to devices dozens of yards away but energy efficient enough to last for months or even to harvest energy from heat or mechanical vibrations a key challenge is designing these circuits with extremely low standby power because most of these devices are just sitting idling waiting for some event to trigger a communication explains anantha chandrakasan the joseph f and nancy p keithley professor in electrical engineering at mit when it s on you want to be as efficient as possible and when it s off you want to really cut off the off state power the leakage power this week at the institute of electrical and electronics engineers international solid state circuits conference chandrakasan s group will present a new transmitter design that reduces off state leakage fold at the same time it provides adequate power for bluetooth transmission or for the even longer range wireless communication protocol the trick is that we borrow techniques that we use to reduce the leakage power in digital circuits chandrakasan explains the basic element of a digital circuit is a transistor in which two electrical leads are connected by a semiconducting material such as silicon in their native states semiconductors are not particularly good conductors but in a transistor the semiconductor has a second wire sitting on top of it which runs perpendicularly to the electrical leads sending a positive charge through this wire known as the gate draws electrons toward it the concentration of electrons creates a bridge that current can cross between the leads but while semiconductors are not naturally very good conductors neither are they perfect insulators even when no charge is applied to the gate some current still leaks across the transistor it s not much but over time it can make a big difference in the battery life of a device that spends most of its time sitting idle going negative chandrakasan along with arun paidimarri an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the paper and nathan ickes a research scientist in chandrakasan s lab reduces the leakage by applying a negative charge to the gate when the transmitter is idle that drives electrons away from the electrical leads making the semiconductor a much better insulator photo left an image of the low power radio chip courtesy of the researchers of course that strategy works only if generating the negative charge consumes less energy than the circuit would otherwise lose to leakage in tests conducted on a prototype chip fabricated through the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company s research program the mit researchers found that their circuit spent only picowatts of power to save picowatts in leakage to generate the negative charge efficiently the mit researchers use a circuit known as a charge pump which is a small network of capacitors electronic components that can store charge and switches when the charge pump is exposed to the voltage that drives the chip charge builds up in one of the capacitors throwing one of the switches connects the positive end of the capacitor to the ground causing a current to flow out the other end this process is repeated over and over the only real power drain comes from throwing the switch which happens about times a second turned on to make the transmitter more efficient when it s active the researchers adopted techniques that have long been a feature of work in chandrakasan s group ordinarily the frequency at which a transmitter can broadcast is a function of its voltage but the mit researchers decomposed the problem of generating an electromagnetic signal into discrete steps only some of which require higher voltages for those steps the circuit uses capacitors and inductors to increase voltage locally that keeps the overall voltage of the circuit down while still enabling high frequency transmissions image right a screenshot of the app shows packets received from the chip courtesy of the researchers what those efficiencies mean for battery life depends on how frequently the transmitter is operational but if it can get away with broadcasting only every hour or so the researchers circuit can reduce power consumption fold ultralow leakage energy is critical for future sensor nodes that need the transmitter to be on only a very small percentage of time says baher haroun director of the embedded processing systems labs at texas instruments ti which helped

below computer chips with superconducting circuits circuits with zero electrical resistance would be to times as energy efficient as today s chips an attractive trait given the increasing power consumption of the massive data centers that power the internet s most popular sites superconducting chips also promise greater processing power superconducting circuits that use so called josephson junctions have been clocked at gigahertz or times the speed of the chip in the iphone but josephson junction chips are big and hard to make most problematic of all they use such minute currents that the results of their computations are difficult to detect for the most part they ve been relegated to a few custom engineered signal detection applications in the latest issue of the journal nano letters mit researchers present a new circuit design that could make simple superconducting devices much cheaper to manufacture and while the circuits speed probably wouldn t top that of today s chips they could solve the problem of reading out the results of calculations performed with josephson junctions the mit researchers adam mccaughan a graduate student in electrical engineering and his advisor professor of electrical engineering and computer science karl berggren call their device the nanocryotron after the cryotron an experimental computing circuit developed in the s by mit professor dudley buck the cryotron was briefly the object of a great deal of interest and federal funding as the possible basis for a new generation of computers but it was eclipsed by the integrated circuit the superconducting electronics community has seen a lot of devices come and go without any real world application mccaughan says but in our paper we have already applied our device to applications that will be highly relevant to future work in superconducting computing and quantum communications superconducting circuits are used in light detectors that can register the arrival of a single light particle or photon that s one of the applications in which the researchers tested the nanocryotron mccaughan also wired together several of the circuits to produce a fundamental digital arithmetic component called a half adder resistance is futile superconductors have no electrical resistance meaning that electrons can travel through them completely unimpeded even the best standard conductors like the copper wires in phone lines or conventional computer chips have some resistance overcoming it requires operational voltages much higher than those that can induce current in a superconductor once electrons start moving through an ordinary conductor they still collide occasionally with its atoms releasing energy as heat superconductors are ordinary materials cooled to extremely low temperatures which damps the vibrations of their atoms letting electrons zip past without collision berggren s lab focuses on superconducting circuits made from niobium nitride which has the relatively high operating temperature of kelvin or minus degrees celsius that s achievable with liquid helium which in a superconducting chip would probably circulate through a system of pipes inside an insulated housing like freon in a refrigerator a liquid helium cooling system would of course increase the power consumption of a superconducting chip but given that the starting point is about percent of the energy required by a conventional chip the savings could still be enormous moreover superconducting computation would let data centers dispense with the cooling systems they currently use to keep their banks of servers from overheating cheap superconducting circuits could also make it much more cost effective to build single photon detectors an essential component of any information system that exploits the computational speedups promised by quantum computing engineered to a t the nanocryotron or ntron consists of a single layer of niobium nitride deposited on an insulator in a pattern that looks roughly like a capital t but where the base of the t joins the crossbar it tapers to only about one tenth its width electrons sailing unimpeded through the base of the t are suddenly crushed together producing heat which radiates out into the crossbar and destroys the niobium nitride s superconductivity a current applied to the base of the t can thus turn off a current flowing through the crossbar that makes the circuit a switch the basic component of a digital computer after the current in the base is turned off the current in the crossbar will resume only after the junction cools back down since the superconductor is cooled by liquid helium that doesn t take long but the circuits are unlikely to top the gigahertz typical of today s chips still they could be useful for some lower end applications where speed isn t as important as energy efficiency their most promising application however could be in making calculations performed by josephson junctions accessible to the outside world josephson junctions use tiny currents that until now have required sensitive lab equipment to detect they re not strong enough to move data to a local memory

dresselhaus teams to identify promising light source for optoelectronic chipsshare september institute professor mildred dresselhaus has teamed with fellow researchers in the electrical engineering and computer science department eecs and from mit s physics department and research laboratory of electronics rle to identify a promising light source for optoelectronic chips that can be tuned to different frequencies crucial to realizing the full potential of moving data with far greater energy efficiency read more in the sept mit news office article by larry hardesty titled toward optical chips a promising light source for optoelectronic chips can be tuned to different frequencies also posted below image above the mit researchers deposited triangular layers of molybdenum disulfide on a silicon substrate at left regions highlighted in blue indicate where the layers overlap courtesy of the researchers mit news office chips that use light rather than electricity to move data would consume much less power and energy efficiency is a growing concern as chips transistor counts rise of the three chief components of optical circuits light emitters modulators and detectors emitters are the toughest to build one promising light source for optical chips is molybdenum disulfide mos which has excellent optical properties when deposited as a single atom thick layer other experimental on chip light emitters have more complex three dimensional geometries and use rarer materials which would make them more difficult and costly to manufacture in the next issue of the journal nano letters researchers from mit s departments of physics and of electrical engineering and computer science will describe a new technique for building mos light emitters tuned to different frequencies an essential requirement for optoelectronic chips since thin films of material can also be patterned onto sheets of plastic the same work could point toward thin flexible bright color displays the researchers also provide a theoretical characterization of the physical phenomena that explain the emitters tunability which could aid in the search for even better candidate materials molybdenum is one of several elements clustered together on the periodic table known as transition metals there s a whole family of transition metals says institute professor emeritus mildred dresselhaus the corresponding author on the new paper if you find it in one then it gives you some incentive to look at it in the whole family joining dresselhaus on the paper are joint first authors shengxi huang a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and xi ling a postdoc in the research laboratory of electronics associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science jing kong and liangbo liang humberto terrones and vincent meunier of rensselaer polytechnic institute monolayer with a twist most optical communications systems such as the fiber optic networks that provide many people with internet and tv service maximize bandwidth by encoding different data at different optical frequencies so tunability is crucial to realizing the full potential of optoelectronic chips the mit researchers tuned their emitters by depositing two layers of mos on a silicon substrate the top layers were rotated relative to the lower layers and the degree of rotation determined the wavelength of the emitted light ordinarily mos is a good light emitter only in monolayers or atom thick sheets as huang explains that s because the two dimensional structure of the sheet confines the electrons orbiting the mos molecules to a limited number of energy states mos like all light emitting semiconductors is what s called a direct band gap material when energy is added to the material either by a laser pump or as an electrical current it kicks some of the electrons orbiting the molecules into higher energy states when the electrons fall back into their initial state they emit their excess energy as light in a monolayer of mos the excited electrons can t escape the plane defined by the material s crystal lattice because of the crystal s geometry the only energy states available to them to leap into cross the light emitting threshold but in multilayer mos the adjacent layers offer lower energy states below the threshold and an excited electron will always seek the lowest energy it can find mind the gap so while the researchers knew that rotating the layers of mos should alter the wavelength of the emitted light they were by no means certain that the light would be intense enough for use in optoelectronics as it turns out however the rotation of the layers relative to each other alters the crystal geometry enough to preserve the band gap the emitted light is not quite as intense as that produced by a monolayer of mos but it s certainly intense enough for practical use and significantly more intense than that produced by most rival technologies the researchers were able to precisely characterize the relationship between the geometries of the rotated layers and the wavelength and intensity of the light emitted for different twisted angles the actual separation between the two layers is different so the coupling between the two layers is different huang explains this interferes with the electron densities in the bilayer system which gives you a different photoluminescence that theoretical characterization should make it much easier to predict whether other transition metal compounds will display similar light emission this thing is something really new says fengnian xia an assistant professor of electrical engineering at yale university it gives you a new model for tuning i expected that this kind of angle adjustment would work but i didn t expect that the effect would be so huge xia adds they get quite significant tuning that s a little bit surprising xia believes that compounds made from other transition metals such as tungsten disulfide or tungsten diselenide could ultimately prove more practical than mos but he agrees that the mit and rpi researchers theoretical framework could help guide future work they use density

congress last week read more in the sept mit news office article by larry hardesty titled reducing traffic congestion with wireless system system that would wirelessly route drivers around congested roadways wins best paper award also posted below at the intelligent transportation systems world congress last week mit researchers received one of the best paper awards for a new system dubbed roadrunner that uses gps style turn by turn directions to route drivers around congested roadways in simulations using data supplied by singapore s land transit authority the researchers compared their system to one currently in use in singapore which charges drivers with dashboard mounted transponders a toll for entering congested areas the singapore system gauges drivers locations with radio transmitters mounted on dozens of gantries scattered around the city like the gantries used in many u s wireless toll systems roadrunner by contrast uses only handheld devices clipped to cars dashboards nonetheless in the simulations it yielded an percent increase in average car speed during periods of peak congestion moreover for purposes of comparison the mit researchers restricted themselves to road access patterns dictated by singapore s existing toll system modifying those patterns encouraging or discouraging the use of different stretches of road could in principle lead to even greater efficiency gains with our system you can draw a polygon on the map and say i want this entire region to be controlled says jason gao a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science who developed the new system together with his advisor professor of electrical engineering and computer science li shiuan peh you could do one thing for a month and test it out and then change it without having to dig up roads or rebuild gantries gao and peh also tested their system on cars in cambridge mass of course cars is not enough to dramatically affect local traffic patterns but it was enough to evaluate the efficiency of the communications system and of the vehicle routing algorithm it also provided reliable data about the system s performance for use in simulations max capacity urban toll systems like the one in singapore designate certain regions with gantries at every entry point as prone to congestion drivers are charged a fee for entering any such region so they have an incentive to avoid it the fee fluctuates over the course of the day according to historical traffic data roadrunner by contrast assigns each such region a maximum number of cars any car entering the region must acquire a virtual authorization that gao and peh call a token if no tokens are free roadrunner routes the car around the region using turn by turn voice prompts the version of roadrunner used in the cambridge tests was largely decentralized a car leaving a region would wirelessly announce that its token was available and a car seeking to enter the region would request it the system used a wireless standard called p a variation on wi fi that uses a narrower slice of the electromagnetic spectrum but is licensed for higher power transmissions so that it has a much larger broadcast range it could be that the time savings promised by roadrunner would be enough to induce commuters to use it but it would also be possible to modify the system so that any car entering a congestion prone region without a token would be assessed a small fine reporting a car for tokenless entry would require uploading data to a central server but it wouldn t require specifying the car s location at a resolution finer than that of the region so gao believes that even though roadrunner relies on gps data it wouldn t compromise drivers privacy any more than existing urban toll systems do in fact he argues it would compromise privacy less since cars that followed the system s routing instructions would never have their locations reported an app for that in their experiments gao and peh used cellphones to control commercial p radios which are about the size of a typical electronic toll dashboard transponder but in the future it may be possible to embed the radios directly into cellphones at the international symposium on low power electronics and design in august gao peh and lead author pilsoon choi a postdoc in peh s group together with researchers at nanyang technological university in singapore presented a paper demonstrating that an p radio built from gallium nitride and controlled by silicon electronics would consume half the power that existing radios do moreover the singapore mit alliance for research and technology smart has developed a technique for integrating gallium nitride into existing silicon chip manufacturing processes and is currently building a chip fabrication facility to implement it in singapore the government already requires every single registered vehicle to have a dash mounted transponder gao says that s already there so you might as well take advantage of it in other places where you don t have that in place it would be easier to deploy it if you said you can download this app and just leave your cellphone on your dashboard a distributed decision process is an alternative to centralized models that has to be explored and as far as i know has been rarely if not ever addressed says jean bergounioux secretary general of atec its france a french industrial research consortium dedicated to novel transportation systems roadrunner offers the possibility of decentralizing as many

teams to bring network on chip with cache coherence closer to realityshare june the potential for multicore computing on a chip has gained new traction with the work by mit electrical engineering and computer science eecs department faculty member li shiuan peh and eecs graduate student bhavya daya as they present a new core chip on which each core acts as a mini internet using a router to complete a communication network for data transport while keeping local data up to date the two are presenting their work this week at the international symposium on computer architecture read more in the june mit news office article by larry hardesty titled researchers unveil experimental core chip design lets chip manage local memory stores efficiently using an internet style communication network also posted below the more cores or processing units a computer chip has the bigger the problem of communication between cores becomes for years li shiuan peh the singapore research professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit has argued that the massively multicore chips of the future will need to resemble little internets where each core has an associated router and data travels between cores in packets of fixed size this week at the international symposium on computer architecture peh s group unveiled a core chip that features just such a network on chip in addition to implementing many of the group s earlier ideas it also solves one of the problems that has bedeviled previous attempts to design networks on chip maintaining cache coherence or ensuring that cores locally stored copies of globally accessible data remain up to date in today s chips all the cores typically somewhere between two and six are connected by a single wire called a bus when two cores need to communicate they re granted exclusive access to the bus but that approach won t work as the core count mounts cores will spend all their time waiting for the bus to free up rather than performing computations in a network on chip each core is connected only to those immediately adjacent to it you can reach your neighbors really quickly says bhavya daya an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the new paper you can also have multiple paths to your destination so if you re going way across rather than having one congested path you could have multiple ones get snoopy one advantage of a bus however is that it makes it easier to maintain cache coherence every core on a chip has its own cache a local high speed memory bank in which it stores frequently used data as it performs computations it updates the data in its cache and every so often it undertakes the relatively time consuming chore of shipping the data back to main memory but what happens if another core needs the data before it s been shipped most chips address this question with a protocol called snoopy because it involves snooping on other cores communications when a core needs a particular chunk of data it broadcasts a request to all the other cores and whichever one has the data ships it back if all the cores share a bus then when one of them receives a data request it knows that it s the most recent request that s been issued similarly when the requesting core gets data back it knows that it s the most recent version of the data but in a network on chip data is flying everywhere and packets will frequently arrive at different cores in different sequences the implicit ordering that the snoopy protocol relies on breaks down imposing order daya peh and their colleagues solve this problem by equipping their chips with a second network which shadows the first the circuits connected to this network are very simple all they can do is declare that their associated cores have sent requests for data over the main network but precisely because those declarations are so simple nodes in the shadow network can combine them and pass them on without incurring delays groups of declarations reach the routers associated with the cores at discrete intervals intervals corresponding to the time it takes to pass from one end of the shadow network to another each router can thus tabulate exactly how many requests were issued during which interval and by which other cores the requests themselves may still take a while to arrive but their recipients know that they ve been issued during each interval the chip s cores are given different hierarchical priorities say for instance that during one interval both core and core issue requests but core has a higher priority core s router may receive core s request well before it receives core s but it will hold it until it s passed along s this hierarchical ordering simulates the chronological ordering of requests sent over a bus so the snoopy protocol still works the hierarchy is shuffled during every interval however to ensure that in the long run all the cores receive equal weight proof pudding cache coherence in multicore chips is a big problem and it s one that gets larger all the time says todd austin a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the university of michigan their contribution is an interesting one they re saying let s get rid of a lot of the complexity that s in existing networks that will create more avenues for communication and our clever communication protocol will sort out all the details it s a much simpler approach and a faster approach it s a really clever idea one of the challenges in academia is convincing industry that our ideas are practical and useful austin adds they ve really taken the best approach to demonstrating

heat more useful current also posted below photo troy van voorhis professor of chemistry left and marc baldo professor of electrical engineering right photo stuart darsch when sunlight shines on today s solar cells much of the incoming energy is given off as waste heat rather than electrical current in a few materials however extra energy produces extra electrons behavior that could significantly increase solar cell efficiency an mit team has now identified the mechanism by which that phenomenon happens yielding new design guidelines for using those special materials to make high efficiency solar cells the results are reported in the journal nature chemistry by mit alumni shane r yost and jiye lee and a dozen other co authors all led by mit s troy van voorhis professor of chemistry and marc baldo professor of electrical engineering in most photovoltaic pv materials a photon a packet of sunlight delivers energy that excites a molecule causing it to release one electron but when high energy photons provide more than enough energy the molecule still releases just one electron plus waste heat a few organic molecules don t follow that rule instead they generate more than one electron per high energy photon that phenomenon known as singlet exciton fission was first identified in the s however achieving it in a functioning solar cell has proved difficult and the exact mechanism involved has become the subject of intense controversy in the field for the past four years van voorhis and baldo have been pooling their theoretical and experimental expertise to investigate this problem in they reported making the first solar cell that gives off extra electrons from high energy visible light which makes up almost half the sun s electromagnetic radiation at the earth s surface according to their estimates applying their technology as an inexpensive coating on silicon solar cells could increase efficiency by as much as percent while that s encouraging understanding the mechanism at work would enable them and others to do even better exciton fission has now been observed in a variety of materials all discovered like the original ones by chance we can t rationally design materials and devices that take advantage of exciton fission until we understand the fundamental mechanism at work until we know what the electrons are actually doing van voorhis says to support his theoretical study of electron behavior within pvs van voorhis used experimental data gathered in samples specially synthesized by baldo and timothy swager mit s john d macarthur professor of chemistry the samples were made of four types of exciton fission molecules decorated with various sorts of spinach bulky side groups of atoms that change the molecular spacing without altering the physics or chemistry to detect fission rates which are measured in femtoseconds seconds the mit team turned to experts including moungi bawendi the lester wolfe professor of chemistry and special equipment at brookhaven national laboratory and the cavendish laboratory at cambridge university under the direction of richard friend van voorhis new first principles formula successfully predicts the fission rate in materials with vastly different structures in addition it confirms once and for all that the mechanism is the classic one proposed in s when excess energy is available in these materials an electron in an excited molecule swaps places with an electron in an unexcited molecule nearby the excited electron brings some energy along and leaves some behind so that both molecules give off electrons the result one photon in two electrons out the simple theory proposed decades ago turns out to explain the behavior van voorhis says the controversial or exotic mechanisms proposed more recently aren t required to explain what s being observed here the results also provide practical guidelines for designing solar cells with these materials they show that molecular packing is important in defining the rate of fission but only to a point when the molecules are very close together the electrons move so quickly that the molecules giving and receiving them don t have time to adjust indeed a far more important factor is choosing a material that has the right inherent energy levels the researchers are pleased with the agreement between their experimental and theoretical data especially given the systems being modeled each molecule has about atoms and each atom has six to electrons these are complicated systems to calculate van voorhis says that s the reason that years ago they couldn t compute these things but now we can david reichman a professor of chemistry at columbia university who was not involved in this research considers the new findings a very important contribution to the singlet fission literature via a synergistic combination of modeling crystal engineering and experiment the authors have provided the first systematic study of parameters influencing fission rates he says their findings should strongly influence design criteria of fission materials away from goals involving molecular packing and toward a focus on the electronic energy

department and head of the analog circuits and biological systems group in mit s research laboratory of electronics rle is featured by the industrial liaison program ilp at mit for his work that blends both biological wet and electronic analog circuits dry in research that could lead to newly engineered immune cells that could detect cancer cells and kill them for example read more in the april mit news office article by steve calechman from the mit industrial liaison program titled mastering the biological and engineering worlds rahul sarpeshkar bridges biology and engineering to advance research and applications in biotechnology medicine and supercomputing also posted below rahul sarpeshkar head of the analog circuits and biological systems group at mit describes himself as an amphibian researcher designing biological systems in two domains the wet world of dna protein molecular circuits in living cells and the dry world of electronic circuits on supercomputing chips the ability to do both wet and dry work at an advanced level is not typical sarpeshkar an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science can do it because he made a fundamental discovery that the same thermodynamic physical laws that cause electron flow in transistors also govern molecular flow in chemical reactions i can literally take some advanced electronic analog circuits and then map them into dna protein circuits and vice versa he says it gives us a very unifying way to synthesize and analyze circuits in both the wet and the dry domains sarpeshkar s discovery opens up possibilities for engineering cells and improving molecular sensing processing and synthesis for the pharmaceutical energy and food industries for example immune cells could be engineered to both detect cancer cells and kill them and highly parallel computational modeling could be used to discover problems with cancer and diabetes genes drug design and cancer treatments supercomputing chips could be used to efficiently design biological circuits in cells underlying all of sarpeshkar s work is the idea of energy efficiency one project promises to enable ultra low power implantable medical devices through the creation of a fuel cell that harvests energy from glucose in the body an implant thus powered would be antenna free and battery free and it could last for the patient s entire lifetime drawing its power solely from the food the patient eats as soon as people power themselves they power the implant sarpeshkar says glucose powered medical devices could revolutionize the field of medical implants including brain implants and pacemakers the power of analog circuits and analog computation one major reason sarpeshkar concentrates on analog circuits and biological systems is that biological systems are much more energy efficient than digital ones in a paper sarpeshkar pointed out that the energy required to duplicate the human brain s complex computations digitally would be at least seven orders of magnitude greater than the energy the brain actually consumes biological cells can t afford energetically to break everything down into zeroes and ones instead they have to utilize grayscale analog signals sarpeshkar s group has shown that analog computation is practical one group member recently engineered a bacterium to compute a square root and other analog functions using only two genetic parts others who tried to do the same computation digitally had to use molecular parts and unlike purely digital synthetic biology sarpeshkar says analog synthetic biology has the promise of scaling the group has also built revolutionary electronic circuits inspired by biology a few years ago they created a radiofrequency chip that could analyze wireless signals over a wide spectrum extremely quickly by mimicking how the human ear analyzes the spectrum of sound signals sarpeshkar is currently investigating circuits inspired by cell biology that perform massively parallel collective analog computing unaffected by noise and performing reliably despite unreliable parts speaking different languages sarpeshkar s ability to bridge seemingly disparate fields finds application in his work outside of the university setting he finds that engaging with the private sector grounds his research in the real world small details that might at first not seem so important to him end up being essential when he works with industry that which is the most fundamental is also the most practical says sarpeshkar quoting ludwig boltzmann

fastpass drastically reduces data transmission queuesshare july eecs faculty members hari balakrishnan and devavrat shah with eecs graduate students amy ousterhout and jonathan perry and hans fugal of facebook have devised a new system to reduce delay time in data center queues using fastpass the name given to the new system the group has experimentally reduced the average queue length of routers by as much as percent in a facebook data center read more in the july mit news office article by larry hardesty titled no wait data centers new system could reduce data transmission delays across server farms by percent also posted below big websites usually maintain their own data centers banks of tens or even hundreds of thousands of servers all passing data back and forth to field users requests like any big decentralized network data centers are prone to congestion packets of data arriving at the same router at the same time are put in a queue and if the queues get too long packets can be delayed at the annual conference of the acm special interest group on data communication in august mit researchers will present a new network management system that in experiments reduced the average queue length of routers in a facebook data center by percent virtually doing away with queues when network traffic was heavy the average latency the delay between the request for an item of information and its arrival shrank nearly as much from microseconds to microseconds like the internet most data centers use decentralized communication protocols each node in the network decides based on its own limited observations how rapidly to send data and which adjacent node to send it to decentralized protocols have the advantage of an ability to handle communication over large networks with little administrative oversight the mit system dubbed fastpass instead relies on a central server called an arbiter to decide which nodes in the network may send data to which others during which periods of time it s not obvious that this is a good idea says hari balakrishnan the fujitsu professor in electrical engineering and computer science and one of the paper s coauthors with fastpass a node that wishes to transmit data first issues a request to the arbiter and receives a routing assignment in return if you have to pay these maybe microseconds to go to the arbiter can you really gain much from the whole scheme says jonathan perry a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science eecs and another of the paper s authors surprisingly you can division of labor balakrishnan and perry are joined on the paper by amy ousterhout another graduate student in eecs devavrat shah the jamieson associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and hans fugal of facebook the researchers experiments indicate that an arbiter with eight cores or processing units can keep up with a network transmitting terabits of data per second that s the equivalent of a server data center with gigabit per second connections transmitting at full bore all the time this paper is not intended to show that you can build this in the world s largest data centers today balakrishnan says but the question as to whether a more scalable centralized system can be built we think the answer is yes moreover the fact that it s two terabits per second on an eight core machine is remarkable balakrishnan says that could have been gigabits per second without the cleverness of the engineering the key to fastpass s efficiency is a technique for splitting up the task of assigning transmission times so that it can be performed in parallel on separate cores the problem balakrishnan says is one of matching source and destination servers for each time slot if you were asked to parallelize the problem of constructing these matchings he says you would normally try to divide the source destination pairs into different groups and put this group on one core this group on another core and come up with these iterative rounds this system doesn t do any of that instead fastpass assigns each core its own time slot and the core with the first slot scrolls through the complete list of pending transmission requests each time it comes across a pair of servers neither of which has received an assignment it schedules them for its slot all other requests involving either the source or the destination are simply passed on to the next core which repeats the process with the next time slot each core thus receives a slightly attenuated version of the list the previous core analyzed bottom line today to avoid latencies in their networks most data center operators simply sink more money into them fastpass would reduce the administrative cost and equipment costs and pain and suffering to provide good service to the users balakrishnan says that allows you to satisfy many more users with the money you would have spent otherwise networks are typically evaluated according to two measures latency or the time a single packet of data takes to traverse the network and throughput or the total amount of data that can pass through the network in a given interval it used to be that everybody was only bothered about throughput says george varghese a principal researcher and partner at microsoft research who studies networking but latency is the new frontier for everybody throughput is the relevant figure when data tends to traverse the network in large chunks varghese explains but in data centers that s less and less common there are many parts to serving a web page and they re all generally pushed onto different machines he says latency matters because when these machines are conspiring to do work on your behalf any time a machine has to wait for a while before getting something

csail news when to toss code let stack handle it share october mit eecs faculty members in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail frans kaashoek nickolai zeldovich and armando solar lezama along with eecs graduate student xi wang have created a system they call stack which will automatically scan programmer s code to avoid compilers from tossing bits of code that might not appear essential stack could prevent loss of code which is vital for security purposes their work titled towards optimization safe systems analyzing the impact of undefined behavior will be presented at the acm symposium on operating systems principles in november read more in the oct mit news office article by larry hardesty titled dude where s my code a new system warns programmers when compilers which convert high level programs into machine readable instructions might simply discard their code also posted below compilers are computer programs that translate high level instructions written in human readable languages like java or c into low level instructions that machines can execute most compilers also streamline the code they produce modifying algorithms specified by programmers so that they ll run more efficiently sometimes that means simply discarding lines of code that appear to serve no purpose but as it turns out compilers can be overaggressive dispensing not only with functional code but also with code that actually performs vital security checks at the acm symposium on operating systems principles in november mit researchers will present a new system dubbed stack that automatically combs through programmers code identifying just those lines that compilers might discard but which could in fact be functional although the paper hasn t appeared yet commercial software engineers have already downloaded stack and begun using it with encouraging results as strange as it may seem to nonprogrammers or people whose only experience with coding is on small tightly managed projects large commercial programs are frequently full of instructions that will never be executed known as dead code when hundreds of developers are working on an application with millions of lines of code that have been continually revised for decades one of them may well end up inserting a seemingly innocuous condition that ensures that a function thousands of lines away written by someone else never gets executed dead code is ubiquitous and compilers should remove it problems arise when compilers also remove code that leads to undefined behavior for some things this is obvious says frans kaashoek the charles a piper professor in the department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs if you re a programmer you should not write a statement where you take some number and divide it by zero you never expect that to work so the compiler will just remove that it s pointless to execute it anyway because there s not going to be any sensible result defining moments over time however compiler writers got a little more aggressive kaashoek says it turns out that the c programming language has a lot of subtle corners to the language specification and there are things that are undefined behavior that most programmers don t realize are undefined behavior a classic example explains xi wang a graduate student in eecs and first author on the new paper is the assumption that if a program attempts to store too large a number at a memory location reserved for an integer the computer will lop off the bits that don t fit in machines integers have a limit wang says whenever you exceed that limit the input value basically wraps around to a smaller value seasoned c programmers will actually exploit this behavior to verify that program inputs don t exceed some threshold rather than writing a line of code that say compares the sum of two numbers to the known threshold for an integer if a b int max they ll check to see whether the sum of the numbers is smaller than one of the addends if a b a whether that is the summation causes the integer to wrap around to a smaller value according to wang programmers give a range of explanations for this practice some say that the intent of the comparison an overflow check is clearer if they use integer wraparound others say that the wraparound comparison executes more efficiently than the more conventional comparison and some maintain that it avoids cluttering up their code with unneeded terminology like int max but whatever the reason while the wraparound check works fine with unsigned integers integers that are always positive it is according to the c language specification undefined for signed integers integers that can be either positive or negative as a consequence some c compilers will simply discard the wraparound comparison and sometimes that can mean dispensing with a security check that guarantees the program s proper execution the fine print complicating things further is the fact that different compilers will dispense with different undefined behaviors some might permit wraparound checks but prohibit other programming shortcuts some might impose exactly the opposite restrictions so wang combed through the c language specifications and identified every undefined behavior that he and his coauthors kaashoek and his fellow eecs professors nickolai zeldovich and armando solar lezama imagined that a programmer might ever inadvertently invoke stack in effect compiles a program twice once just looking to excise dead code and a second time to excise dead code and undefined behavior then it identifies all the code that was cut the second time but not the first and warns the programmer that it could pose problems the mit researchers tested their system on several open source programs in one case the developers of a program that performs database searches refused to believe that their code had bugs even after they d examined the instructions flagged by stack xi sent them

sanchez beckmann devise jigsaw a software solution to cache managementshare september daniel sanchez assistant professor in the mit electrical engineering and computer science department eecs and member of the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail and his graduate student nathan beckmann have developed a software alternative to manage high speed on chip memory cache they presented their work jigsaw scalable software de ned caches at this week s international conference on parallel architectures and compilation techniques read more in the sept mit news office article by larry hardesty titled managing multicore memory mit research shows that it may be time to let software rather than hardware manage the high speed on chip memory banks known as caches also posted below graphic courtesy christine daniloff mit news office in today s computers moving data to and from main memory consumes so much time and energy that microprocessors have their own small high speed memory banks known as caches which store frequently used data traditionally managing the caches has required fairly simple algorithms that can be hard wired into the chips in the st century however in order to meet consumers expectations for steadily increasing computational power chipmakers have had to begin equipping their chips with more and more cores or processing units and as cores proliferate cache management becomes much more difficult daniel sanchez an assistant professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science believes that it s time to turn cache management over to software this week at the international conference on parallel architectures and compilation techniques sanchez and his student nathan beckmann presented a new system dubbed jigsaw that monitors the computations being performed by a multicore chip and manages cache memory accordingly in experiments simulating the execution of hundreds of applications on and core chips sanchez and beckmann found that jigsaw could speed up execution by an average of percent with more than twofold improvements in some cases while actually reducing energy consumption by as much as percent and sanchez believes that the performance improvements offered by jigsaw should only increase as the number of cores does location location location in most multicore chips each core has several small private caches but there s also what s known as a last level cache which is shared by all the cores that cache is on the order of to percent of the chip sanchez says it is a significant fraction of the area because it s so crucial to performance if we didn t have that cache some applications would be an order of magnitude slower physically the last level cache is broken into separate memory banks and distributed across the chip for any given core accessing the nearest bank takes less time and consumes less energy than accessing those farther away but because the last level cache is shared by all the cores most chips assign data to the banks randomly jigsaw by contrast monitors which cores are accessing which data most frequently and on the fly calculates the most efficient assignment of data to cache banks for instance data being used exclusively by a single core is stored near that core whereas data that all the cores are accessing with equal frequency is stored near the center of the chip minimizing the average distance it has to travel jigsaw also varies the amount of cache space allocated to each type of data depending on how it s accessed data that is reused frequently receives more space than data that is accessed infrequently or only once in principle optimizing cache space allocations requires evaluating how the chip as a whole will perform given every possible allocation of cache space to all the computations being performed on all the cores that calculation would be prohibitively time consuming but by ignoring some particularly convoluted scenarios that are extremely unlikely to arise in practice sanchez and beckmann were able to develop an approximate optimization algorithm that runs efficiently even as the number of cores and the different types of data increases dramatically quick study of course since the optimization is based on jigsaw s observations of the chip s activity it s the optimal thing to do assuming that the programs will behave in the next milliseconds the way they did in the last milliseconds sanchez says but there s very strong experimental evidence that programs typically have stable phases of hundreds of milliseconds or even seconds sanchez also points out that the new paper represents simply his group s first cut at turning cache management over to software going forward they will be investigating among other things the co design of hardware and software to improve efficiency even further and the possibility of allowing programmers themselves to classify data according to their memory access patterns so that jigsaw doesn t have to rely entirely on observation to evaluate memory allocation more and more of our computation is happening in data centers say jason mars an assistant professor of computer science at the university of michigan in the data center space it s going to be very important to be able to have the microarchitecture partition and allocate resources on an application by application basis when you have multiple applications that are running inside a single box he explains there s a point of interference where jobs can hurt the performance of each other with current commodity hardware there are a limited number of mechanisms we have to manage how jobs hurt each other mars cautions that a system like jigsaw dispenses with a layer of abstraction between chip hardware and the software running on it companies like intel once they expose the microarchitectural configurations through the software layer they have to keep that interface over future generations of the processor mars says so if intel wanted to do something audacious with the

csail news devadas hardware disguises cloud servers memory access patterns thwarting timing attacks share july srini devadas the edwin sibley webster professor of electrical engineering and computer science and members of the computational structures group in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail have developed a new system that not only disguises a server s memory access patterns but also prevents attacks that rely on how long computations take the group presented their work on this new secure hardware component named ascend at the june international symposium on computer architecture read more in the mit news office july article by larry hardesty titled protecting data in the cloud a new hardware design makes data encryption more secure by disguising cloud servers memory access patterns posted below in its entirety cloud computing outsourcing computational tasks over the internet could give home computer users unprecedented processing power and let small companies launch sophisticated web services without building massive server farms but it also raises privacy concerns a bank of cloud servers could be running applications for customers at once unbeknownst to the hosting service one of those applications might have no purpose other than spying on the other encryption could make cloud servers more secure only when the data is actually being processed would it be decrypted the results of any computations would be re encrypted before they re sent off chip in the last years or so however it s become clear that even when a computer is handling encrypted data its memory access patterns the frequency with which it stores and accesses data at different memory addresses can betray a shocking amount of private information at the international symposium on computer architecture in june mit researchers described a new type of secure hardware component dubbed ascend that would disguise a server s memory access patterns making it impossible for an attacker to infer anything about the data being stored ascend also thwarts another type of attack known as a timing attack which attempts to infer information from the amount of time that computations take computational trade off similar designs have been proposed in the past but they ve generally traded too much computational overhead for security this is the first time that any hardware design has been proposed it hasn t been built yet that would give you this level of security while only having about a factor of three or four overhead in performance says srini devadas the edwin sibley webster professor of electrical engineering and computer science whose group developed the new system people would have thought it would be a factor of the trivial way of obscuring memory access patterns devadas explains would be to request data from every address in the memory whether a memory chip or a hard drive and throw out everything except the data stored at the one address of interest but that would be much too time consuming to be practical what devadas and his collaborators graduate students ling ren xiangyao yu and christopher fletcher and research scientist marten van dijk do instead is to arrange memory addresses in a data structure known as a tree a family tree is a familiar example of a tree in which each node in this example a person s name is attached to only one node above it the node representing the person s parents but may connect to several nodes below it the person s children with ascend addresses are assigned to nodes randomly every node lies along some path or route through the tree that starts at the top and passes from node to node without backtracking until arriving at a node with no further connections when the processor requires data from a particular address it sends requests to all the addresses in a path that includes the one it s really after to prevent an attacker from inferring anything from sequences of memory access every time ascend accesses a particular memory address it randomly swaps that address with one stored somewhere else in the tree as a consequence accessing a single address multiple times will very rarely require traversing the same path less computation to disguise an address by confining its dummy requests to a single path rather than sending them to every address in memory ascend exponentially reduces the amount of computation required to disguise an address in a separate paper which is as yet unpublished but has been posted online the researchers prove that querying paths provides just as much security as querying every address in memory would ascend also protects against timing attacks suppose that the computation being outsourced to the cloud is the mammoth task of comparing a surveillance photo of a criminal suspect to random photos on the web the surveillance photo itself would be encrypted and thus secure from prying eyes but spyware in the cloud could still deduce what public photos it was being compared to and the time the comparisons take could indicate something about the source photos photos of obviously different people could be easy to rule out but photos of very similar people might take longer to distinguish so ascend s memory access scheme has one final wrinkle it sends requests to memory at regular intervals even when the processor is busy and requires no new data that way attackers can t tell how long any given computation is taking mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

automatically grading programming homework software that identifies errors in students programs however idiosyncratic their approaches could be a boon for online learning posted below researchers at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail working with a colleague at microsoft research have developed a new software system that can automatically identify errors in students programming assignments and recommend corrections teaching assistants at mit have already begun using the software but some variation on it could help solve one of the biggest problems faced by massive open online courses moocs like those offered through edx the online learning initiative created by mit and harvard university how to automate grading the system grew out of work on program synthesis the automatic generation of computer programs that meet a programmer s specifications at csail s computer aided programming group which is led by armando solar lezama the nbx career development assistant professor of computer science and engineering a paper describing the work will be presented this month at the association for computing machinery s programming language design and implementation conference joining solar lezama on the paper are first author rishabh singh a graduate student in his group and sumit gulwani of microsoft research one challenge when tas grade these assignments is that there are many different ways to solve the same problem singh says for a ta it can be quite hard to figure out what type of solution the student is trying to do and what s wrong with it one advantage of the new software is that it will identify the minimum number of corrections necessary to get a program working no matter how unorthodox the programmer s approach pursuing alternatives the new system does depend on a catalogue of the types of errors that student programmers tend to make one such error is to begin counting from zero on one pass through a series of data items and from one in another another is to forget to add the condition of equality to a comparison as in if a is greater than or equal to b do x the first step for the researchers automated grading algorithm is to identify all the spots in a student s program where any of the common errors might have occurred at each of those spots the possible error establishes a range of variations in the program s output one output if counting begins at zero for instance another if it begins at one every possible combination of variations represents a different candidate for the corrected version of the student s program the search space is quite big singh says you typically get possible student solutions after doing these corrections this is where the work on synthesis that we ve been doing comes in we can efficiently search this space within seconds one key insight from program synthesis is that the relationships between a program s inputs and outputs can be described by a set of equations which can be generated automatically and solving equations is generally more efficient than running lots of candidate programs to see what answers they give but wherever a possible error has established a range of outputs in the original program the corresponding equation has a parameter a variable that can take on a limited range of values finding values for those variables that yield working programs is itself a daunting search problem limiting options the csail researchers algorithm solves it by first selecting a single target input that should elicit a specific output from a properly working program that requirement in itself wipes out a large number of candidate programs many of them will give the wrong answer even for that one input various candidates remain however and the algorithm next selects one of them at random for that program it then finds an input that yields an incorrect output that input becomes a new target input for all the remaining candidate programs and so forth iterating back and forth between fixed inputs and fixed programs this process converges on a working program with surprising speed most of the corrections that are wrong are going to be really wrong solar lezama explains they re going to be wrong for most inputs so by getting rid of the things that are wrong on even a small number of inputs you ve already gotten rid of most of the wrong things it s actually hard to write a wrong thing that is going to be wrong only on one carefully selected input but if that s the case then once you have that one carefully selected input that s that the researchers are currently evaluating how their system might be used to grade homework assignments in programming moocs in some sense the system works too well currently as a tool to help tas grade homework assignments it provides specific feedback including the line numbers of specific errors and suggested corrections but for online students part of the learning process may very well involve discovering errors themselves the researchers are currently experimenting with variations on the software that indicate the location and nature of errors with different

dbseer to address the realities of cloud computing particularly database applications requiring over expenditure for hardware in june professor madden and members of the mit database group including first author of two papers on this work postdoctoral associate barzan mozafari will present their work at the annual meeting of the association for computing machinery s special interest group on management of data sigmod see their work performance and resource modeling in highly concurrent oltp workloads read more in the march mit news office article by larry hardesty titled making cloud computing more efficient for database driven applications new software could reduce hardware requirements by percent while actually improving performance posted below in its entirety image courtesy christine daniloff mit news for many companies moving their web application servers to the cloud is an attractive option since cloud computing services can offer economies of scale extensive technical support and easy accommodation of demand fluctuations but for applications that depend heavily on database queries cloud hosting can pose as many problems as it solves cloud services often partition their servers into virtual machines each of which gets so many operations per second on a server s central processing unit so much space in memory and the like that makes cloud servers easier to manage but for database intensive applications it can result in the allocation of about times as much hardware as should be necessary and the cost of that overprovisioning gets passed on to customers mit researchers are developing a new system called dbseer that should help solve this problem and others such as the pricing of cloud services and the diagnosis of application slowdowns at the recent biennial conference on innovative data systems research the researchers laid out their vision for dbseer and in june at the annual meeting of the association for computing machinery s special interest group on management of data sigmod they will unveil the algorithms at the heart of dbseer which use machine learning techniques to build accurate models of performance and resource demands of database driven applications dbseer s advantages aren t restricted to cloud computing either teradata a major database company has already assigned several of its engineers the task of importing the mit researchers new algorithm which has been released under an open source license into its own software virtual limitations barzan mozafari a postdoc in the lab of professor of electrical engineering and computer science samuel madden and lead author on both new papers explains that with virtual machines server resources must be allocated according to an application s peak demand you re not going to hit your peak load all the time mozafari says so that means that these resources are going to be underutilized most of the time moreover mozafari says the provisioning for peak demand is largely guesswork it s very counterintuitive mozafari says but you might take on certain types of extra load that might help your overall performance increased demand means that a database server will store more of its frequently used data in its high speed memory which can help it process requests more quickly on the other hand a slight increase in demand could cause the system to slow down precipitously if for instance too many requests require modification of the same pieces of data which need to be updated on multiple servers it s extremely nonlinear mozafari says mozafari madden postdoc alekh jindal and carlo curino a former member of madden s group who s now at microsoft use two different techniques in the sigmod paper to predict how a database driven application will respond to increased load mozafari describes the first as a black box approach dbseer simply monitors fluctuations in both the number and type of user requests and system performance and uses machine learning techniques to correlate the two this approach is good at predicting the consequences of fluctuations that don t fall too far outside the range of the training data gray areas often however database managers or prospective cloud computing customers will be interested in the consequences of a fourfold tenfold or even hundredfold increase in demand for those types of predictions mozafari explains dbseer uses a gray box model which takes into account the idiosyncrasies of particular database systems for instance mozafari explains updating data stored on a hard drive is time consuming so most database servers will try to postpone that operation as long as they can instead storing data modifications in the much faster but volatile main memory at some point however the server has to commit its pending modifications to disk and the criteria for making that decision can vary from one database system to another the version of dbseer presented at sigmod includes a gray box model of mysql one of the most widely used database systems the researchers are currently building a new model for another popular system postgresql although adapting the model isn t a negligible undertaking models tailored to just a handful of systems would cover the large majority of database driven web applications the researchers tested their prediction algorithm against both a set of benchmark data called tpc c that s commonly used in database research and against real world data on modifications to the wikipedia database on average the model was about percent accurate in predicting cpu use and percent accurate in predicting the bandwidth consumed by disk operations we re really fascinated and thrilled that someone is doing this work says doug brown a database software architect at teradata we ve already taken the code and are prototyping right now initially brown says teradata will use the mit researchers prediction algorithm to determine customers resource requirements

students improve the quality of life safety and independence of the boston home residents with instaaid mobile application also posted below far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing theodore roosevelt once said in a speech in mit senior in computer science beth hadley takes these words to heart in the past academic year she has been a pivotal force behind instaaid an ipad application that enables residents at the boston home tbh to access assistance from any area of the facility thus increasing their safety and quality of life during the fall of in the course principles and practices in assistive technologies or ppat hadley and her classmates senior laura d aquila and junior tanya talkar formed a team with margaret marie a tbh resident to design an application that transformed the nurse call system at the home margaret has provided incredible vision and direction for our project she not only provided concrete ideas but also inspired us with her desire to help others ultimately she instilled in us the drive and dedication to truly make an impact hadley says for many residents of the home calling for help is not a simple task most residents have limited mobility due to conditions such as multiple sclerosis ms or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als making it difficult and many times impossible to reach the help button wired to the wall many residents however already use ipads attached to their wheelchairs the home is extremely innovative when it comes to technology and yet their nurse call system hadn t been improved in years hadley explains we aimed to change that i had been thinking for a while about how antiquated our nurse call system was and how it is tied to a single place in our room which makes it so ineffective especially when people are not in their bed and we re an active group so often people are not in their bed so people need to be able to access help when they re out and about marie says while the first iteration of the application was developed during the ppat class hadley turned it into her senior thesis project and continued to improve it she tested and revised several prototypes and incorporated feedback from tbh residents and staff throughout turning an experimental product into a robust and sustainable call system downloadable from the apple app store the application garnered attention at the recent undergraduate research conference eecscon where hadley won the crowd favorite poster presentation for creating an accessible call system technology for people the instaaid nurse call project represents the myriad of ways that technology can be used to enhance the lives of people with disabilities says don fredette adaptive technology specialist at the boston home the application transforms the process of providing help to residents with two interfaces one for the resident and one for the nurse users can request water aid or signal an absolute emergency at the touch of a button whether they are in their room in the garden or even away from the home s premises users can also send custom text messages or initiate a video chat making the platform usable in a variety of ways by people of all abilities and needs for instance residents unable to speak can communicate their requests by typing the message on their ipad the custom notification helps nurses identify real emergencies and dispatch the right personnel for each call instaaid is now the preferred communication for residents to reach assistance in any location on our campus marva serotkin ceo of the boston home says starting in december two residents including marie used the application and provided feedback since the app has been officially launched this spring many ipad users at the home have adopted the new technology communication between caregivers and residents can be a challenge fredette says the application gives residents piece of mind that anywhere where they have their ipad with them they can make their needs known photo right teamwork and collaboration has been the driving force behind the success of this project pictured here are team members left to right don fredette william li g beth hadley margaret marie laura d aquila and tanya talkar for me this project helped illuminate the vast difference between developing a prototype and actually introducing a new piece of technology to a community hadley explains instaaid is not just another research endeavor rather it is about working with people and designing a solution tailored to their needs it s this kind of project that reminds me why i love technology so much and why i love to share my technical skills with others hadley says the application can be downloaded and deployed beyond the boston home at other

eugene wu with sam madden professor of computer science and engineering in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail have released a new tool called dbwipes that pinpoints aberrations and determines which data sources to investigate read more in the aug mit news office article by larry hardesty titled visual control of big data data visualization tool identifies sources of aberrant results and recomputes visualizations without them also posted below in the age of big data visualization tools are vital with a single glance at a graphic display a human being can recognize patterns that a computer might fail to find even after hours of analysis but what if there are aberrations in the patterns or what if there s just a suggestion of a visual pattern that s not distinct enough to justify any strong inferences or what if the pattern is clear but not what was to be expected the database group at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory has released a data visualization tool that lets users highlight aberrations and possible patterns in the graphical display the tool then automatically determines which data sources are responsible for which it could be for instance that just a couple of faulty sensors among dozens are corrupting a very regular pattern of readings or that a few underperforming agents are dragging down a company s sales figures or that a clogged vent in a hospital is dramatically increasing a few patients risk of infection big data is big business visualizing big data is big business tableau software which sells a suite of visualization tools is a billion company but in creating attractive informative graphics most visualization software discards a good deal of useful data if you look at the way people traditionally produce visualizations of any sort they would have some big rich data set that has maybe hundreds of millions of data points or records and they would do some reduction of the set to a few hundred or thousands of records at most says samuel madden a professor of computer science and engineering and one of the database group s leaders the problem with doing that sort of reduction is that you lose information about where those output data points came from relative to the input data set if one of these data points is crazy is an outlier for example you don t have any real ability to go back to the data set and ask where did this come from and what were its properties that s one of the problems solved by the new visualization tool dubbed dbwipes for his thesis work eugene wu a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science who developed dbwipes with madden and adjunct professor michael stonebraker designed a novel provenance tracking system for large data sets if a visualization system summarizes million data entries into points to render on the screen then each of the points will in some way summarize perhaps by averaging million data points wu s provenance tracking system provides a compact representation of the source of the summarized data so that users can easily trace visualized data back to the source and conversely track source data to the pixels that are rendered by it the idea of provenance tracking is not new but wu s system is particularly well suited to the task of tracking down outliers in data visualizations rather than simply telling the user the million data entries that were used to compute the outliers it first identifies those that most influenced the outlier values and summarizes those data entries in human readable terms best paper wu and madden s work on their scorpion algorithm was selected as one of the best papers of the very large database conference last year the algorithm tracks down the records responsible for particular aspects of a dbwipes visualization and then efficiently recalculates the visualization to either exclude or emphasize the data they contain if some of the points in the visualization suggest a regular pattern the user can highlight them and mark them as normal data if some of the points disrupt that pattern the user can highlight them and mark them as outlier data and if the pattern is surprising the user can draw the anticipated pattern on screen scorpion then tracks down the provenance of the highlighted points and filters the provenance down to the subset that most influenced the outliers their paper introduces several properties about the specific computation that can be used to develop more efficient algorithms for finding these subsets scorpion madden says was partly motivated by a study conducted by a researcher at a boston hospital who noticed that a subset of patients in one of the hospital s wards was incurring much higher treatment costs than the rest any number of factors could have been responsible the patients age and fitness the severity of their conditions their particular constellations of symptoms their health plans or perhaps something as banal as their proximity to the hospital nothing could be ruled out after six months of work the researcher concluded that most of the variance in patients treatment costs could be explained by a single variable their doctors it turned out that three doctors on the hospital staff in an effort to leave no stone unturned simply prescribed more interventions than their peers as an experiment wu and madden turned scorpion loose on the researcher s data within five minutes it had concluded that the data point most strongly correlated with the increase in patients treatment costs was the names of their doctors because it was combing through a massive data set

computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail big data is no longer just about processing a huge number of bytes but doing things with data that you couldn t do previously increasingly data is coming at you really fast and it s much more complex it s not just tabular data you can easily stick into a spreadsheet or a database the velocity and variety challenges stem from faster computers and networks as well as the proliferation of data types such as streaming media social networking trends and real time financial transactions suddenly we re trying to process things like

madden helped mostak mine the growing wealth of location data served up with mobile tweets tagged with geocodes or the location of the people sending the tweets out of the hundreds of millions of tweets sent every day there are to million geocoded tweets typically using the position sensors on smartphones says madden mapd plots them on a map over time and allows users to search them and interact with them using real time animations mapd harvests the processing power of the phones graphic processing units to parallelize computing tasks such as querying and rendering very large data sets the data can be used to analyze localized and time stamped events ranging from political movements to responses to new products to patterns of disease or weather people tweet when it s raining or snowing or if they have the flu or went to the doctor says madden those things can be visualized in a very compelling way mapd poses challenges in both variety and a velocity says madden the data is text not tabular so you need different ways of pre processing compressing and formatting it to make it computable he says you have to convert it into maps that show tweet density visualizations in

the patient s ear researchers at mit s microsystems technology laboratory mtl together with physicians from harvard medical school and the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary meei have developed a new low power signal processing chip that could lead to a cochlear implant that requires no external hardware the implant would be wirelessly recharged and would run for about eight hours on each charge

fall and his colleagues rui jin and nathan ickes both in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science will also exhibit a prototype charger that plugs into an ordinary cell phone and can recharge the signal processing chip in roughly two minutes the idea with this design is that you could use a phone with an adaptor to charge the cochlear implant so you don t have to be plugged in says anantha chandrakasan the joseph f and nancy p keithley professor of electrical engineering and corresponding author on the new paper or you could imagine a smart pillow so you charge overnight and the next day it just functions adaptive reuse existing cochlear implants use an external microphone to gather sound but the new implant would instead use the natural microphone of the middle ear which is almost always intact in cochlear implant patients the researchers design exploits the mechanism of a different type of medical device known as a middle ear implant delicate bones in the middle ear known as ossicles convey the vibrations of the eardrum to the cochlea the small spiral chamber in the inner ear that converts acoustic signals to electrical in patients with middle ear implants the cochlea is functional but one of the ossicles the stapes doesn t vibrate with enough force to stimulate the auditory nerve a middle ear implant consists of a tiny sensor that detects the ossicles vibrations and an actuator that helps drive the stapes accordingly the new device would use the same type of sensor but the signal it generates would travel to a microchip implanted in the ear which would convert it to an electrical signal and pass it on to an electrode in the cochlea lowering the power requirements of the converter chip was the key to dispensing with the skull mounted hardware chandrakasan s lab at mtl specializes in low power chips and the new converter deploys several of the tricks that the lab has developed over the years such as tailoring the arrangement of low power filters and amplifiers to the precise acoustic properties of the incoming signal but chandrakasan and his colleagues also developed a new signal generating circuit that reduces the chip s power consumption by an additional to percent the key was to specify a new waveform the basic electrical signal emitted by the chip which is modulated to encode acoustic information that is more power efficient to generate but still stimulates the auditory nerve in the appropriate way verification the waveform was based on prior research involving simulated nerve fibers but the mit researchers tailored it for cochlear implants and found a low power way to implement it in hardware two of their collaborators at meei konstantina stankovic an ear surgeon who co led the study with chandrakasan and don eddington tested it on four patients who already had cochlear implants and found that it had no effect on their ability to hear working with another collaborator at meei heidi nakajima the researchers have also demonstrated that the chip and sensor are able to pick up and process speech played into a the middle ear of a human cadaver it s very cool says lawrence lustig director of the cochlear implant center at the university of california at san francisco there s a much greater stigma of having a hearing loss than there is of having a visual loss so people would be very keen on losing the externals for that reason alone but then there s also the added functional benefit of not having to take it off when you re near water or worrying about components getting lost or broken or stolen so there are some important practical considerations as well lustig points out

ghaffari teams to maximize network bandwidth new use of vertex connectivityshare december electrical engineering and computer science department graduate student mohsen ghaffari also a member of mit s computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail has developed a new way to use vertex connectivity that could ultimately lead to communication protocols that will allow as much network bandwidth as possible ghaffari and members of an international team will present this work in january at the acm siam symposium on discrete algorithms in portland oregon read more in the dec mit news office article by mit news correspondent helen knight titled new approach to vertex connectivity could maximize networks bandwidth technique advances understanding of a basic concept in graph theory paralleling advances in edge connectivity also posted below computer scientists are constantly searching for ways to squeeze ever more bandwidth from communications networks now a new approach to understanding a basic concept in graph theory known as vertex connectivity could ultimately lead to communications protocols the rules that govern how digital messages are exchanged that coax as much bandwidth as possible from networks graph theory plays a central role in mathematics and computer science and is used to describe the relationship between different objects each graph consists of a number of nodes or vertices which represent the objects and connecting lines between them known as edges which signify the relationships between them a communications network for example can be represented as a graph with each node in the network being one vertex and a connection between two nodes depicted as an edge one of the fundamental concepts within graph theory is connectivity which has two variants edge connectivity and vertex connectivity these are numbers that determine how many lines or nodes would have to be removed from a given graph to disconnect it the lower the edge connectivity or vertex connectivity number of a graph therefore the easier it is to disconnect or break apart in this way both concepts show how robust a network is against failure and how much flow can pass through it whether the flow of information in a communications network traffic flow in a transportation system or fluid flow in hydraulics reducing edge connectivity s edge however while a great deal of research has been carried out in mathematics to solve problems associated with edge connectivity there has been relatively little success in answering questions about vertex connectivity but at the acm siam symposium on discrete algorithms in portland ore in january mohsen ghaffari a graduate student in the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory at mit will present a new technique for addressing vertex connectivity problems this could ultimately help us understand how to build more robust and faster networks says ghaffari who developed the new approach alongside keren censor hillel at the technion and fabian kuhn at the university of freiburg in the s mathematicians william tutte and crispin nash williams separately developed theories about structures called edge disjoint spanning trees which now serve as one of the key technical tools in many problems about edge connectivity a spanning tree is a subgraph or a graph within a graph in which all of the nodes are connected by the smallest number of edges a set of spanning trees within a graph are called edge disjoint if they do not share any of these connecting lines if a network contains three edge disjoint spanning trees for example information can flow in parallel along each of these trees at the same time meaning three times more bandwidth than would be possible in a graph containing just one tree the higher the number of edge disjoint spanning trees the larger the information flow ghaffari says the results of tutte and nash williams show that each graph contains almost as many spanning trees as its edge connectivity he says now the team has created an analogous theory about vertex connectivity they did this by breaking down the graph into separated groups of nodes known as connected dominating sets in graph theory a group of nodes is called a connected dominating set if all of the vertices within it are connected to one another and any other node within the graph is adjacent to at least one of those inside the group in this way information can be disseminated among the nodes of the set and then passed to any other node in the network so in a similar way to tutte and nash williams results for edge connectivity each graph contains almost as many vertex disjoint connected dominating sets as its vertex connectivity ghaffari says so if you think of an application like broadcasting information through a network we can now decompose the network into many groups each being one connected dominating set he says each of these groups is then going to be responsible for broadcasting some set of the messages and all groups work in parallel to broadcast all the messages fast almost as fast as possible the team has now developed an algorithm that can carefully decompose a network into many connected dominating sets in this way it can structure so called wireless ad hoc networks in which individual nodes route data by passing it from one to the next to ensure the best possible speed of information flow we want to be able to spread as much information as possible per unit of time to create faster and faster networks ghaffari says and when a graph has a better vertex

medard teams to identify the insecurities in encryptionshare august muriel m dard professor of electrical engineering in the mit eecs department and principal investigator in the research laboratory of electronics rle and eecs graduate student falvio du pin calmon have teamed with researchers at the national university of ireland to demonstrate that the security of many keyless entry systems may not be as secure as previously thought m dard and the nui team will present their work at the asilomar conference on signals and systems in september read more in the aug mit news office article by larry hardesty titled encryption is less secure than we thought for years most information theoretic analyses of cryptographic systems have made a mathematical assumption that turns out to be wrong also posted below information theory the discipline that gave us digital communication and data compression also put cryptography on a secure mathematical foundation since when the paper that created information theory first appeared most information theoretic analyses of secure schemes have depended on a common assumption unfortunately as a group of researchers at mit and the national university of ireland nui at maynooth demonstrated in a paper presented at the recent international symposium on information theory view pdf that assumption is false in a follow up paper being presented this fall at the asilomar conference on signals and systems the same team shows that as a consequence the wireless card readers used in many keyless entry systems may not be as secure as previously thought in information theory the concept of information is intimately entwined with that of entropy two digital files might contain the same amount of information but if one is shorter it has more entropy if a compression algorithm such as winzip or gzip worked perfectly the compressed file would have the maximum possible entropy that means that it would have the same number of s and s and the way in which they were distributed would be totally unpredictable in information theoretic parlance it would be perfectly uniform traditionally information theoretic analyses of secure schemes have assumed that the source files are perfectly uniform in practice they rarely are but they re close enough that it appeared that the standard mathematical analyses still held we thought we d establish that the basic premise that everyone was using was fair and reasonable says ken duffy one of the researchers at nui and it turns out that it s not on both papers duffy is joined by his student mark christiansen muriel m dard a professor of electrical engineering at mit and her student fl vio du pin calmon the problem m dard explains is that information theoretic analyses of secure systems have generally used the wrong notion of entropy they relied on so called shannon entropy named after the founder of information theory claude shannon who taught at mit from to shannon entropy is based on the average probability that a given string of bits will occur in a particular type of digital file in a general purpose communications system that s the right type of entropy to use because the characteristics of the data traffic will quickly converge to the statistical averages although shannon s seminal paper dealt with cryptography it was primarily concerned with communication and it used the same measure of entropy in both discussions but in cryptography the real concern isn t with the average case but with the worst case a codebreaker needs only one reliable correlation between the encrypted and unencrypted versions of a file in order to begin to deduce further correlations in the years since shannon s paper information theorists have developed other notions of entropy some of which give greater weight to improbable outcomes those it turns out offer a more accurate picture of the problem of codebreaking when m dard duffy and their students used these alternate measures of entropy they found that slight deviations from perfect uniformity in source files which seemed trivial in the light of shannon entropy suddenly loomed much larger the upshot is that a computer turned loose to simply guess correlations between the encrypted and unencrypted versions of a file would make headway much faster than previously expected it s still exponentially hard but it s exponentially easier than we thought duffy says one implication is that an attacker who simply relied on the frequencies with which letters occur in english words could probably guess a user selected password much more quickly than was previously thought attackers often use graphics processors to distribute the problem duffy says you d be surprised at how quickly you can guess stuff in their asilomar paper the researchers apply the same type of mathematical analysis in a slightly different way they consider the case in which an attacker is from a distance able to make a noisy measurement of the password stored on a credit card with an embedded chip or a key card used in a keyless entry system noise is the engineer s term for anything that degrades an electromagnetic signal such as physical obstructions out of phase reflections or other electromagnetic interference noise comes in lots of different varieties the familiar white noise of sleep aids is one but so is pink noise black noise and more exotic sounding types of noise such as power law noise or poisson noise in this case rather than prior knowledge about the statistical frequency of the symbols used in a password the attacker has prior knowledge about the probable noise characteristics of the environment phase noise with one set of parameters is more probable than phase noise with another set of parameters which in turn is more probable than brownian noise and so on armed with these statistics an attacker could infer the password stored on the card much more rapidly than was previously thought

larger area devices their work has been published in the latest issue of physical review b image above atoms of niobium and nitrogen in an ultrathin superconducting film that helped mit researchers discover a universal law of superconductivity courtesy yachin ivry and mit news read more in the dec mit news office article by larry hardesty titled new law for superconductors mathematical description of relationship between thickness temperature and resistivity could spur advances also posted below mit researchers have discovered a new mathematical relationship between material thickness temperature and electrical resistance that appears to hold in all superconductors they describe their findings in the latest issue of physical review b the result could shed light on the nature of superconductivity and could also lead to better engineered superconducting circuits for applications like quantum computing and ultralow power computing we were able to use this knowledge to make larger area devices which were not really possible to do previously and the yield of the devices increased significantly says yachin ivry a postdoc in mit s research laboratory of electronics and the first author on the paper ivry works in the quantum nanostructures and nanofabrication group which is led by karl berggren a professor of electrical engineering and one of ivry s co authors on the paper among other things the group studies thin films of superconductors superconductors are materials that at temperatures near absolute zero exhibit no electrical resistance this means that it takes very little energy to induce an electrical current in them a single photon will do the trick which is why they re useful as quantum photodetectors and a computer chip built from superconducting circuits would in principle consume about one hundredth as much energy as a conventional chip thin films are interesting scientifically because they allow you to get closer to what we call the superconducting to insulating transition ivry says superconductivity is a phenomenon that relies on the collective behavior of the electrons so if you go to smaller and smaller dimensions you get to the onset of the collective behavior vexing variation specifically ivry studied niobium nitride a material favored by researchers because in its bulk form it has a relatively high critical temperature the temperature at which it switches from an ordinary metal to a superconductor but like most superconductors its critical temperature goes down when it s deposited in the thin films on which nanodevices rely previous theoretical work had characterized niobium nitride s critical temperature as a function of either the thickness of the film or its measured resistivity at room temperature but neither theory seemed to explain the results ivry was getting we saw large scatter and no clear trend he says it made no sense because we grew them in the lab under the same conditions so the researchers conducted a series of experiments in which they held constant either thickness or sheet resistance the material s resistance per unit area while varying the other parameter they then measured the ensuing changes in critical temperature a clear pattern emerged thickness times critical temperature equaled a constant call it a divided by sheet resistance raised to a particular power call it b after deriving that formula ivry checked it against other results reported in the superconductor literature his initial excitement evaporated however with the first outside paper he consulted though most of the results it reported fit his formula perfectly two of them were dramatically awry then a colleague who was familiar with the paper pointed out that its authors had acknowledged in a footnote that those two measurements might reflect experimental error when building their test device the researchers had forgotten to turn on one of the gases they used to deposit their films broadening the scope the other niobium nitride papers ivry consulted bore out his predictions so he began to expand to other superconductors each new material he investigated required him to adjust the formula s constants a and b but the general form of the equation held across results reported for roughly three dozen different superconductors it wasn t necessarily surprising that each superconductor should have its own associated constant but ivry and berggren weren t happy that their equation required two of them when ivry graphed a against b for all the materials he d investigated however the results fell on a straight line finding a direct relationship between the constants allowed him to rely on only one of them in the general form of his equation but perhaps more interestingly the materials at either end of the line had distinct physical properties those at the top had highly disordered or technically amorphous crystalline structures those at the bottom were more orderly or granular so ivry s initial attempt to banish an inelegance in his equation may already provide some insight into the physics of superconductors at small scales none of the admitted theory up to now explains with such a broad class of materials the relation of critical temperature with sheet resistance and thickness says claude chapelier a superconductivity researcher at france s alternative energies and atomic energy commission there are several models that do not predict the same things chapelier says he would like to see a theoretical explanation for that relationship but in the meantime this is very convenient for technical applications he says because there is a lot of spreading of the results and nobody knows whether they will get good films for superconducting devices by putting a material into this law you know

mit s school of engineering with mit professor of chemistry moungi bawendi and graduate students chia hao chuang and patrick brown have developed new quantum dot photovoltaic cells that demonstrate significant efficiency in solar cells with no need for high temperature or vacuum conditions to operate or to be produced their work has been published in nature materials and a companion piece in acs nano with mit professor of materials science and engineering jeffrey grossman read more in the may mit news office article by david l chandler titled improving a new breed of solar cells quantum dot photovoltaics set new record for efficiency in such devices could unlock new uses also posted below solar cell technology has advanced rapidly as hundreds of groups around the world pursue more than two dozen approaches using different materials technologies and approaches to improve efficiency and reduce costs now a team at mit has set a new record for the most efficient quantum dot cells a type of solar cell that is seen as especially promising because of its inherently low cost versatility and light weight while the overall efficiency of this cell is still low compared to other types about percent of the energy of sunlight is converted to electricity the rate of improvement of this technology is one of the most rapid seen for a solar technology the development is described in a paper published in the journal nature materials by mit professors moungi bawendi and vladimir bulovi and graduate students chia hao chuang and patrick brown the new process is an extension of work by bawendi the lester wolfe professor of chemistry to produce quantum dots with precisely controllable characteristics and as uniform thin coatings that can be applied to other materials these minuscule particles are very effective at turning light into electricity and vice versa since the first progress toward the use of quantum dots to make solar cells bawendi says the community in the last few years has started to understand better how these cells operate and what the limitations are the new work represents a significant leap in overcoming those limitations increasing the current flow in the cells and thus boosting their overall efficiency in converting sunlight into electricity many approaches to creating low cost large area flexible and lightweight solar cells suffer from serious limitations such as short operating lifetimes when exposed to air or the need for high temperatures and vacuum chambers during production by contrast the new process does not require an inert atmosphere or high temperatures to grow the active device layers and the resulting cells show no degradation after more than five months of storage in air bulovi the fariborz maseeh professor of emerging technology and associate dean for innovation in mit s school of engineering explains that thin coatings of quantum dots allow them to do what they do as individuals to absorb light very well but also work as a group to transport charges this allows those charges to be collected at the edge of the film where they can be harnessed to provide an electric current the new work brings together developments from several fields to push the technology to unprecedented efficiency for a quantum dot based system the paper s four co authors come from mit s departments of physics chemistry materials science and engineering and electrical engineering and computer science the solar cell produced by the team has now been added to the national renewable energy laboratories listing of record high efficiencies for each kind of solar cell technology the overall efficiency of the cell is still lower than for most other types of solar cells but bulovi points out silicon had six decades to get where it is today and even silicon hasn t reached the theoretical limit yet you can t hope to have an entirely new technology beat an incumbent in just four years of development and the new technology has important advantages notably a manufacturing process that is far less energy intensive than other types chuang adds every part of the cell except the electrodes for now can be deposited at room temperature in air out of solution it s really unprecedented the system is so new that it also has potential as a tool for basic research there s a lot to learn about why it is so stable there s a lot more to be done to use it as a testbed for physics to see why the results are sometimes better than we expect bulovi says a companion paper written by three members of the same team along with mit s jeffrey grossman the carl richard soderberg associate professor of power engineering and three others appears this month in the journal acs nano explaining in greater detail the science behind the strategy employed to reach this efficiency breakthrough the new work represents a turnaround for bawendi who had spent much of his career working with quantum dots i was somewhat of a skeptic four years ago he says but his team s research since then has clearly demonstrated quantum dots potential in solar cells he adds arthur nozik a research professor in chemistry at the university of colorado who was not involved in this research says this result represents a significant advance for the applications of quantum dot films and the technology of low temperature solution processed quantum dot photovoltaic cells there is still a long way to go before quantum dot solar cells are commercially viable but this latest development is a nice step toward this ultimate goal the work was supported by

system that could evaluate information from the robot s sensors and readjust the trajectories of its limbs times a second or at a rate of one kilohertz that sounds daunting but as tedrake explains past a certain point the high sampling rate actually becomes an advantage one one thousandth of a second allows so little time for circumstances to change that the imposition of new constraints usually occurs piecemeal from one sensor reading to the next the algorithm rarely has to meet more than one or two new constraints which it can usually manage with just a small adjustment as one test of the kilohertz controller members of the mit team instructed their robot to dismount from the utility vehicle they d been using to test its driving skills once it had transferred all its weight to one foot they started jumping up and down on the vehicle s fenders the robot maintained its balance human factors for several of the robot s tasks the mit researchers exploited the fact that the contest allowed human operators to communicate with their robots although their communication links would be erratic although the robot has an onboard camera its chief sensor is a laser rangefinder which fires pulses of light in different directions and measures the time they take to return this produces a huge cloud of individual points some of which belong to the same objects and some of which don t resolving that point cloud into distinct objects is an extremely difficult task which computer vision researchers have been wrestling with for decades it would be almost impossible to perform in real time so the mit researchers built a library of generic geometric representations of objects the robot was likely to encounter such as the fallen lumber whose removal was one of its tasks during the competition finals the remote operator can look at an image captured by the robot s camera identify the appropriate library of object representations and superimpose the point cloud produced by the laser rangefinder then the operator clicks the track pad or mouse button twice to roughly indicate the ends of the objects in the image algorithms then automatically cluster points together according to the geometric models picking out the individual objects that the robot will have to manipulate when the robot enters a new environment its rangefinder readings can tell it where nearby objects are but it doesn t know which are safe to step on so the mit researchers also developed an interface that allows the robot s operator to click on a graphical representation of the robot s surroundings identifying flat surfaces that offer secure footholds from the robot s sensor readings the algorithm automatically determines the extent of the safe areas by locating the first significant changes in altitude so if the operator clicks at a single point on an uncluttered floor the interface highlights an expanse of space that extends outward from that point to the first obstacles the rangefinder registers similarly if the operator clicks a single point on one step of a staircase the algorithm highlights most of the rest of the step but stops short of its edges if you look at what happened at drc darpa robotics challenge it was a lot of teleoperation a lot of scripted pieces of movement and then a human telling the robot which movement to execute in great detail

planning to manipulation the breadth and depth of challenges have forced us to think creatively program nimbly and sleep sporadically the csail team finished mere inches away from winning the competition ultimately earning sixth place out of teams the pentagon sponsored event was aimed at developing mobile robots to perform useful tasks in disaster relief situations and was inspired by the fukushima nuclear disaster for the finals the researchers had to program their robots to do the same eight tasks as in the december trials but without safety tethers power cords or consistent communications links regular network blackouts which were meant to simulate an emergency scenario greatly benefited the autonomy minded mit team for most tasks their researchers had planned high level actions that were partitioned into smaller chunks that the robot then executed based on existing templates when you have outages of to seconds being able to move continuously is vital if you want to avoid losing precious time says csail postdoc scott kuindersma who served as mit s planning and control lead each team had two chances to finish the tasks as quickly as possible on mit s first run the team s boston dynamics built atlas robot broke its right arm trying to get out of the car after the driving task despite that setback the team finished with seven out of the eight points by programming the robot to do all of the remaining tasks left handed on the team s second run atlas sprinted through the first three tasks faster than any other team and was making extremely strong progress on the drill task until its drill slipped out from the wall causing another spill and ending the team s chances to finish first recovering from the broken arm was a highlight for me kuindersma says it was an unplanned demonstration of the adaptiveness of our software and the amazing people behind it in the months leading up to the event researchers logged more than a few hour days toiling in the tight quarters of a little used warehouse on albany street in cambridge to hand code hundreds of complex algorithms for motion planning perception and control the end product was a comprehensive software system that gathers large swaths of data about the robot s surroundings to understand its location create motion plans and compute how its distinct joints have to move in order to perform the different manipulations researchers developed algorithms for every last one of the robot s many micro actions including taking footsteps avoiding collisions performing during network outages and maintaining balance at such a level that it could stand on one foot while getting out of a five foot wide utility vehicle in contrast to popular approaches that move a robot incrementally towards a goal the mit team opted to adopt a method called whole body motion planning which solves for an entire motion in advance when you re working in an environment that s filled with uncertainty programming a robot to slowly nudge towards a goal can mean getting stuck when new obstacles pop up says csail phd student andr s valenzuela with our approach we can be extremely confident that we will finish the task that we set out to execute that said the team experienced more than its fair share of hiccups along the way the week before the final competition some of atlas leg joints had started wearing out forcing researchers to calibrate its motions to be more conservative a few months earlier it fell off a cinderblock and sheared off its entire right arm we tend to lose sight of the fact that as humans our systems have been trained to perform these kinds of actions for decades valenzuela says it s little wonder that it s so difficult to get robots to do these same tasks after

eecs professor and director of the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail daniela rus have developed a new algorithm that significantly reduces the time it takes for several robots to plan and execute a task their work was cited this week by the institute for electrical and electronics engineers international conference on robotics and automation with two best paper awards photo

office article by larry hardesty titled helping robots put it all together new algorithm lets autonomous robots divvy up assembly tasks on the fly also posted below today s industrial robots are remarkably efficient as long as they re in a controlled environment where everything is exactly where they expect it to be but put them in an unfamiliar setting where they have to think for themselves and their efficiency plummets and the difficulty of on the fly motion planning increases exponentially with the number of robots involved for even a simple collaborative task a team of say three autonomous robots might have to think for several hours to come up with a plan of attack this week at the institute for electrical and electronics engineers international conference on robotics and automation a group of mit researchers were nominated for two best paper awards for a new algorithm that can significantly reduce robot teams planning time the plan the algorithm produces may not be perfectly efficient but in many cases the savings in planning time will more than offset the added execution time the researchers also tested the viability of their algorithm by using it to guide a crew of three robots in the assembly of a chair we re really excited about the idea of using robots in more extensive ways in manufacturing says daniela rus the andrew and erna viterbi professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science whose group developed the new algorithm for this we need robots that can figure things out for themselves more than current robots do we see this algorithm as a step in that direction rus is joined on the paper by three researchers in her lab first author mehmet dogar a postdoc and andrew spielberg and stuart baker both graduate students in electrical engineering and computer science grasping consequences the problem the researchers address is one in which a group of robots must perform an assembly operation that has a series of discrete steps some of which require multirobot collaboration at the outset none of the robots knows which parts of the operation it will be assigned everything s determined on the fly computationally the problem is already complex enough given that at any stage of the operation any of the robots could perform any of the actions and during the collaborative phases they have to avoid colliding with each other but what makes planning really time consuming is determining the optimal way for each robot to grasp each object it s manipulating so that it can successfully complete not only the immediate task but also those that follow it sometimes the grasp configuration may be valid for the current step but problematic for the next step because another robot or sensor is needed rus says the current grasping formation may not allow room for a new robot or sensor to join the team so our solution considers a multiple step assembly operation and optimizes how the robots place themselves in a way that takes into account the entire process not just the current step the key to the researchers algorithm is that it defers its most difficult decisions about grasp position until it s made all the easier ones that way it can be interrupted at any time and it will still have a workable assembly plan if it hasn t had time to compute the optimal solution the robots may on occasion have to drop and regrasp the objects they re holding but in many cases the extra time that takes will be trivial compared to the time required to compute a comprehensive solution principled procrastination the algorithm begins by devising a plan that completely ignores the grasping problem this is the equivalent of a plan in which all the robots would drop everything after every stage of the assembly operation then approach the next stage as if it were a freestanding task then the algorithm considers the transition from one stage of the operation to the next from the perspective of a single robot and a single part of the object being assembled if it can find a grasp position for that robot and that part that will work in both stages of the operation but which won t require any modification of any of the other robots behavior it will add that grasp to the plan otherwise it postpones its decision once it s handled all the easy grasp decisions it revisits the ones it s postponed now it broadens its scope slightly revising the behavior of one or two other robots at one or two points in the operation if necessary to effect a smooth transition between stages but again if even that expanded scope proves too limited it defers its decision if the algorithm were permitted to run to completion its last few grasp decisions might require the modification of every robot s behavior at every step of the assembly process which can be a hugely complex task it will often be more efficient to just let the robots

lets children program a robot using stickers embodies new theories about programming languages also posted below researchers at the mit media laboratory are developing a system that enables young children to program interactive robots by affixing stickers to laminated sheets of paper not only could the system introduce children to programming principles but it could also serve as a research tool to help determine which computational concepts children can grasp at what ages and how interactive robots can best be integrated into educational curricula last week at the association for computing machinery and institute of electrical and electronics engineers international conference on human robot interaction the researchers presented the results of an initial study of the system which investigated its use by children ages to we did not want to put this in the digital world but rather in the tangible world says michal gordon a postdoc in media arts and sciences and lead author on the new paper it s a sandbox for exploring computational concepts but it s a sandbox that comes to the children s world in their study the mit researchers used an interactive robot called dragonbot developed by the personal robots group at the media lab which is led by associate professor of media arts and sciences cynthia breazeal dragonbot has audio and visual sensors a speech synthesizer a range of expressive gestures and a video screen for a face that can assume a variety of expressions the programs that children created dictated how dragonbot would react to stimuli it s programming in the context of relational interactions with the robot says edith ackermann a developmental psychologist and visiting professor in the personal robots group who with gordon and breazeal is a co author on the new paper this is what children do they re learning about social relations so taking this expression of computational principles to the social world is very appropriate lessons that stick the root components of the programming system are triangular and circular stickers which represent stimuli and responses respectively and arrow stickers which represent relationships between them children can first create computational templates by affixing triangles circles and arrows to sheets of laminated paper they then fill in the details with stickers that represent particular stimuli like thumbs up or down and responses like the narrowing or widening of dragonbot s eyes there are also blank stickers on which older children can write their own verbal cues and responses researchers in the personal robotics group are developing a computer vision system that will enable children to convey new programs to dragonbot simply by holding pages of stickers up to its camera but for the purposes of the new study the system s performance had to be perfectly reliable so one of the researchers would manually enter the stimulus and response sequences devised by the children using a tablet computer with a touch screen interface that featured icons depicting all the available options to introduce a new subject to the system the researchers would ask him or her to issue an individual command by attaching a single response sticker to a small laminated sheet when presented with the sheet dragonbot would execute the command but when it s presented with a program it instead nods its head and says i ve got it thereafter it will execute the specified chain of responses whenever it receives the corresponding stimulus even the youngest subjects were able to distinguish between individual commands and programs and interviews after their sessions suggested that they understood that programs unlike commands modified the internal state of the robot the researchers plan additional studies to determine the extent of their understanding paradigm shift the sticker system is in fact designed to encourage a new way of thinking about programming one that may be more consistent with how computation is done in the st century the systems we re programming today are not sequential as they were or years back gordon says a system has many inputs coming in complex state and many outputs a cellphone for instance might be monitoring incoming transmissions over both wi fi and the cellular network while playing back a video transmitting the audio over bluetooth and running a timer that s set to go off when the rice on the stove has finished cooking as a graduate student in computer science at the weizmann institute of science in israel gordon explains she worked with her advisor david harel on a new programming paradigm called scenario based programming the idea is to describe your code in little scenarios and the engine in the back connects them she explains you could think of it as rules with triggers and actions gordon and her colleagues new system could be used to introduce children to the principles of conventional sequential programming but it s well adapted to scenario based programming it s actually how we think about how programs are written before we try to integrate it into a whole programming artifact she says so i was thinking why not try

hardesty titled vision system for household robots new algorithm could enable household robots to better identify objects in cluttered environments also posted below for household robots ever to be practical they ll need to be able to recognize the objects they re supposed to manipulate but while object recognition is one of the most widely studied topics in artificial intelligence even the best object detectors still fail much of the time researchers at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory believe that household robots should take advantage of their mobility and their relatively static environments to make object recognition easier by imaging objects from multiple perspectives before making judgments about their identity matching up the objects depicted in the different images however poses its own computational challenges in a paper appearing in a forthcoming issue of the international journal of robotics research the mit researchers show that a system using an off the shelf algorithm to aggregate different perspectives can recognize four times as many objects as one that uses a single perspective while reducing the number of misidentifications they then present a new algorithm that is just as accurate but that in some cases is times as fast making it much more practical for real time deployment with household robots if you just took the output of looking at it from one viewpoint there s a lot of stuff that might be missing or it might be the angle of illumination or something blocking the object that causes a systematic error in the detector says lawson wong a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and lead author on the new paper one way around that is just to move around and go to a different viewpoint first stab wong and his thesis advisors leslie kaelbling the panasonic professor of computer science and engineering and tom s lozano p rez the school of engineering professor of teaching excellence considered scenarios in which they had to different images of household objects clustered together on a table in several of the scenarios the clusters included multiple instances of the same object closely packed together which makes the task of matching different perspectives more difficult the first algorithm they tried was developed for tracking systems such as radar which must also determine whether objects imaged at different times are in fact the same it s been around for decades wong says and there s a good reason for that which is that it really works well it s the first thing that most people think of for each pair of successive images the algorithm generates multiple hypotheses about which objects in one correspond to which objects in the other the problem is that the number of hypotheses compounds as new perspectives are added to keep the calculation manageable the algorithm discards all but its top hypotheses at each step even so sorting through them all after the last hypothesis has been generated is a time consuming task representative sampling in hopes of arriving at a more efficient algorithm the mit researchers adopted a different approach their algorithm doesn t discard any of the hypotheses it generates across successive images but it doesn t attempt to canvass them all either instead it samples from them at random since there s significant overlap between different hypotheses an adequate number of samples will generally yield consensus on the correspondences between the objects in any two successive images to keep the required number of samples low the researchers adopted a simplified technique for evaluating hypotheses suppose that the algorithm has identified three objects from one perspective and four from another the most mathematically precise way to compare hypotheses would be to consider every possible set of matches between the two groups of objects the set that matches objects and in the first view to objects and in the second the set that matches objects and in the first to objects and in the second the set that matches objects and in the first view to objects and in the second and so on in this case if you include the possibilities that the detector has made an error and that some objects are occluded from some views that approach would yield different sets of matches instead the researchers algorithm considers each object in the first group separately and evaluates its likelihood of mapping onto an object in the second group so object in the first group could map onto objects or in the second as could object and so on again with the possibilities of error and occlusion factored in this approach requires only comparisons it does however open the door to nonsensical results the algorithm could conclude that the most likely match for object in the second group is object in the first and it could also conclude that the most likely match for object in the second group is object in the first so the researchers algorithm also looks for such double mappings and re evaluates them that takes extra time but not nearly as much as considering aggregate mappings would in this case the algorithm would perform comparisons more than but significantly less than mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

photographer has begun to create a new system that uses drones light equipped autonomous robots to create accurate lighting while communicating with the camera mounted interface durand and several other researchers will report on their work at an upcoming international symposium in august read more in the july mit news office article by larry hardesty titled drone lighting autonomous vehicles could automatically assume the right positions for photographic lighting also posted below lighting is crucial to the art of photography but lights are cumbersome and time consuming to set up and outside the studio it can be prohibitively difficult to position them where ideally they ought to go researchers at mit and cornell university hope to change that by providing photographers with squadrons of small light equipped autonomous robots that automatically assume the positions necessary to produce lighting effects specified through a simple intuitive camera mounted interface at the international symposium on computational aesthetics in graphics visualization and imaging in august they take the first step toward realizing this vision presenting a prototype system that uses an autonomous helicopter to produce a difficult effect called rim lighting in which only the edge of the photographer s subject is strongly lit according to manohar srikanth who worked on the system as a graduate student and postdoc at mit and is now a senior researcher at nokia he and his coauthors mit professor of computer science and engineering fr do durand and cornell s kavita bala who also did her phd at mit chose rim lighting for their initial experiments precisely because it s a difficult effect it s very sensitive to the position of the light srikanth says if you move the light say by a foot your appearance changes dramatically intuitive control with the new system the photographer indicates the direction from which the rim light should come and the miniature helicopter flies to that side of the subject the photographer then specifies the width of the rim as a percentage of its initial value repeating that process until the desired effect is achieved thereafter the robot automatically maintains the specified rim width if somebody is facing you the rim you would see is on the edge of the shoulder but if the subject turns sideways so that he s looking degrees away from you then he s exposing his chest to the light which means that you ll see a much thicker rim light srikanth says so in order to compensate for the change in the body the light has to change its position quite dramatically in the same way srikanth says the system can compensate for the photographer s movements in both cases the camera itself supplies the control signal roughly times a second the camera produces an image that is not stored on its own memory card but transmitted to a computer running the researchers control algorithm the algorithm evaluates the rim width and adjusts the robot s position accordingly the challenge was the manipulation of the very difficult dynamics of the uav unmanned aerial vehicle and the feedback from the lighting estimation durand says that s where we put a lot of our efforts to make sure that the control of the drone could work at the very high speed that s needed just to keep the thing flying and deal with the information from the lidar the uav s laser rangefinder and the rim lighting estimation quick study as srikanth explains that required some algorithmic streamlining when we first started looking at it we thought we d come up with a very fancy algorithm that looks at the whole silhouette of the subject and tries to figure out the morphological properties the curve of the edge and so on and so forth but it turns out that those calculations are really time consuming srikanth says instead the algorithm simply looks for the most dramatic gradations in light intensity across the whole image and measures their width with a rim lit subject most of those measurements will congregate around the same value which the algorithm takes to be the width of the rim in experiments this quick approximation was able to keep up with the motions of both the subject and the photographer while maintaining a consistent rim width the researchers tested their prototype in a motion capture studio which uses a bank of high speed cameras to measure the position of specially designed light reflecting tags with millimeter accuracy several such tags were affixed to the helicopter but srikanth explains the purpose of the tests was to evaluate the control algorithm which performed well algorithms that gauge robots location based only on measurements from onboard sensors are a major area of research in robotics and the new system could work with any of them even rim lighting srikanth says doesn t require the millimeter accuracy of the motion capture studio we only need a resolution of or centimeters he says rim lighting is a particularly interesting effect because you want to precisely position the lighting to bring out silhouettes says ravi ramamoorthi a professor of computer science and engineering at the the university of california san diego other effects are in some sense easier one doesn t need as precise positioning for frontal lighting so the technique would probably generalize to other light effects but at the same time as precise control and manipulation may not be needed manual static positioning might be adequate clearly taking the uav system out of the lab and into the real world and making it robust enough to be practical is a challenge ramamoorthi adds but also something that should be doable given the rapid advancement of

simulations involve small groups of irobot creates programmable robots that have the same chassis as the roomba vacuum cleaner reasonable doubt in multiagent systems in general in the real world it s very hard for them to communicate effectively says christopher amato a postdoc in csail and first author on the new paper if you have a camera it s impossible for the camera to be constantly streaming all of its information to all the other cameras similarly robots are on networks that are imperfect so it takes some amount of time to get messages to other robots and maybe they can t communicate in certain situations around obstacles an agent may not even have perfect information about its own location amato says which aisle of the warehouse it s actually in for instance moreover when you try to make a decision there s some uncertainty about how that s going to unfold he says maybe you try to move in a certain direction and there s wind or wheel slippage or there s uncertainty across networks due to packet loss so in these real world domains with all this communication noise and uncertainty about what s happening it s hard to make decisions the new mit system which amato developed with co authors leslie kaelbling the panasonic professor of computer science and engineering and george konidaris a fellow postdoc takes three inputs one is a set of low level control algorithms which the mit researchers refer to as macro actions which may govern agents behaviors collectively or individually the second is a set of statistics about those programs execution in a particular environment and the third is a scheme for valuing different outcomes accomplishing a task accrues a high positive valuation but consuming energy accrues a negative valuation school of hard knocks amato envisions that the statistics could be gathered automatically by simply letting a multiagent system run for a while whether in the real world or in simulations in the warehousing application for instance the robots would be left to execute various macro actions and the system would collect data on results robots trying to move from point a to point b within the warehouse might end up down a blind alley some percentage of the time and their communication bandwidth might drop some other percentage of the time those percentages might vary for robots moving from point b to point c the mit system takes these inputs and then decides how best to combine macro actions to maximize the system s value function it might use all the macro actions it might use only a tiny subset and it might use them in ways that a human designer wouldn t have thought of suppose for instance that each robot has a small bank of colored lights that it can use to communicate with its counterparts if their wireless links are down what typically happens is the programmer decides that red light means go to this room and help somebody green light means go to that room and help somebody amato says in our case we can just say that there are three lights and the algorithm spits out whether or not to use them and what each color means the mit researchers work frames the problem of multiagent control as something called a partially observable markov decision process or pomdp pomdps and

frontiers of knowledge award in the information and communications technologies category the bbva foundation cited his influential role in defining the field of artificial intelligence and in mentoring many of the leading minds in today s artificial intelligence community the award also recognizes his contributions to the fields of mathematics cognitive science robotics and philosophy in learning of the award which brings a prize of minsky reconfirmed his conviction that one day we will develop machines that will be as smart as humans but he added how long this takes will depend on how many people we have working on the right problems right now there is a shortage of both researchers and funding minsky joined the department of electrical engineering and computer science faculty in and co founded the artificial intelligence laboratory now the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory the following year in he became a founding member of the media lab where he was named the toshiba professor of media arts and sciences and where he continues to teach and mentor commenting on the award nicholas negroponte co founder and chairman emeritus of the media lab says marvin s genius is accompanied by extreme kindness and humor he listens well and is oracle like in his capability to debug an enormously complex situation with a simple short phrase through the years we have known each other he has taught me to tackle the big problems patrick winston the ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science and former director of mit s artificial intelligence lab says one day when i was wondering what i wanted to do i went to one of marvin s lectures invited by a friend at the end i said to myself i want to do what he does and ever since that is what i have done minsky views the brain as a machine whose functioning can be studied and replicated in a computer which would teach us in turn to better understand the human brain and higher level mental functions he has been recognized for his work focusing on how we might endow machines with common sense the knowledge humans acquire every day through experience how for example do we teach a

self assembling robots are hereshare october self assembling robots were dismissed even by daniela rus professor of computer science and engineering and director of the mit computer science and

that it could be done they will present their work on the new self propelled robots at the ieee rsj international conference on intelligent robots and systems read more in the oct mit news article by

arbitrary shapes also posted below don t miss the followup oct article by robert krulwich for wgbh news watch daniela she s up to something big in when an mit senior named john romanishin proposed a new design for modular robots to his robotics professor daniela rus she said that can t be done two years later rus showed her colleague hod lipson a robotics researcher at cornell university a video of prototype robots based on romanishin s design in action that can t be done lipson said in november romanishin now a research scientist in mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail rus and postdoc kyle gilpin will establish once and for all that it can be done when they present a paper describing their new robots at the ieee rsj international conference on intelligent robots and systems known as m blocks the robots are cubes with no external moving parts nonetheless they re able to climb over and around one another leap through the air roll across the ground and even move while suspended upside down from metallic surfaces inside each m block is a flywheel that can reach speeds of revolutions per minute when the flywheel is braked it imparts its angular momentum to the cube on each edge of an m block and on every face are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other it s one of these things that the modular robotics community has been trying to do for a long time says rus a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and director of csail we just needed a creative insight and somebody who was passionate enough to keep coming at it despite being discouraged embodied abstraction as rus explains researchers studying reconfigurable robots have long used an abstraction called the sliding cube model in this model if two cubes are face to face one of them can slide up the side of the other and without changing orientation slide across its top the sliding cube model simplifies the development of self assembly algorithms but the robots that implement them tend to be much more complex devices rus group for instance previously developed a modular robot called the molecule which consisted of two cubes connected by an angled bar and had separate motors we were quite proud of it at the time rus says according to gilpin existing modular robot systems are also statically stable meaning that you can pause the motion at any point and they ll stay where they are what enabled the mit researchers to drastically simplify their robots design was giving up on the principle of static stability there s a point in time when the cube is essentially flying through the air gilpin says and you are depending on the magnets to bring it into alignment when it lands that s something that s totally unique to this system that s also what made rus skeptical about romanishin s initial proposal i asked him build a prototype rus says then i said ok maybe i was wrong sticking the landing to compensate for its static instability the researchers robot relies on some ingenious engineering on each edge of a cube are two cylindrical magnets mounted like rolling pins when two cubes approach each other the magnets naturally rotate so that north poles align with south and vice versa any face of any cube can thus attach to any face of any other the cubes edges are also beveled so when two cubes are face to face there s a slight gap between their magnets when one cube begins to flip on top of another the bevels and thus the magnets touch the connection between the cubes becomes much stronger anchoring the pivot on each face of a cube are four more pairs of smaller magnets arranged symmetrically which help snap a moving cube into place when it lands on top of another as with any modular robot system the hope is that the modules can be miniaturized the ultimate aim of most such research is hordes of swarming microbots that can self assemble like the liquid steel androids in the movie terminator ii and the simplicity of the cubes design makes miniaturization promising but the researchers believe that a more refined version of their system could prove useful even at something like its current scale armies of mobile cubes could temporarily repair bridges or buildings during emergencies or raise and reconfigure scaffolding for building projects they could assemble into different types of furniture or heavy equipment as needed and they could swarm into environments hostile or inaccessible to humans diagnose problems and reorganize themselves to provide solutions strength in diversity the researchers also imagine that among the mobile cubes could be special purpose cubes containing cameras or lights or battery packs or other equipment which the mobile cubes could transport in the vast majority of other modular systems an individual module cannot move on its own gilpin says if you drop one of these along the way

following the selection by technology review of rethink robotics as one of disruptive companies founded by brooks in rethink robotics is stocking manufacturers with easily taught assembly line capable robots that can work safely alongside humans read more in the aug mit news office article by rob matheson titled professor emeritus rodney brooks refines the sequel to irobot rodney brooks startup rethink robotics is producing robots that can adapt to manufacturing tasks and the factory environment also posted below professor emeritus rodney brooks gained fame in the s for co founding irobot an mit spinoff that brought the world the roomba and other innovative helpful robots he s since moved on to robots that are bigger but no less revolutionary brooks newest startup rethink robotics headquartered in boston is producing robots that can work safely in factories alongside humans and demonstrate common sense adapting to their tasks and environment rethink s first commercial model baxter released in january is a human sized two armed robot that can be programmed to learn repetitive production tasks material handling testing and sorting light assembly and packing and unpacking any worker tech savvy or not can program baxter by moving the robot s arms demonstrating the desired tasks and locations and pressing buttons on a control panel the robot s face eyes and eyebrows displayed on an lcd screen indicates its status and where its attention is focused sensors on the robot s head allow it to recognize when people are nearby and sensors on its joints allow it to reduce the force of impact should it detect a collision valuable and novel safety features baxter changes its movements to accommodate the world that s a revolution in robots for manufacturing by itself says brooks a former director of mit s computer science and artificial intelligence lab and now rethink s chief technology officer and the fact that it s aware of people and safe to be around people is another revolution in the manufacturing environment as importantly brooks says baxter is built from parts manufactured in the united states rethink s boston office works on quality assurance and software development releasing new software to expand baxter s capabilities every few months the product s domestic roots are contributing to the company s popularity brooks says our customers have a lot of emotional investment in that hundreds of baxters have sold nationwide and the robot has been praised for its safety and affordability among other things technology review listed baxter as one of breakthrough technologies of time named the robot a top invention of rethink itself named to technology review s most recent list of disruptive companies has raised more than million in funding making u s manufacturing more attractive a baxter type robot first appealed to brooks as a means of helping america compete with low cost overseas labor and making its factories competitive globally i decided maybe i could do something with robots to make manufacturing more attractive in the united states he says five years of prototyping and field research at u s factories followed rethink s founding this field experience led brooks and his colleagues to jettison many features such as a speech interface because factories are noisy and touchscreens because workers commonly wear gloves it s all this obvious little stuff that as an academic doesn t register when you re starting to commercialize something like this so you have to go into the field to find it out brooks says once it had the design rethink began reducing baxter s development costs by replacing costly mechanical components with computation advanced software allows the robot to rectify mechanical irregularities such as troubles with gears and features like cameras help the robot detect objects without requiring precision accuracy but the robot is designed with some impressive hardware one key feature which allows the robot to sense and soften collisions was invented and patented at mit baxter s arms contain a mechanism called a series elastic actuator that was invented by gill pratt a former mit faculty member and matt williamson brooks former phd student traditional actuators involve a motor driving a gearbox which in turn drives a joint all are rigidly attached to one another making a device fast and accurate but rendering it unable to sense force which can be dangerous elastic actuators on the other hand are spring based and allow the device to sense force slowing when a human touches it as well as absorbing friction and shocks williamson now directs rethink s technology development a number of other rethink employees hail from mit as well as from northeastern and tufts universities worcester polytechnic institute and other institutions in and around boston which brooks calls the world s epicenter for robotics you can t have a robotics company in boston without employing people from mit he says brooks who left mit in adds that the institute s entrepreneurial ecosystem has grown dramatically since he co founded irobot with then graduate students helen greiner sm and colin angle sm it has a lot for students he says everyone s doing something with entrepreneurship there now a tool for factories and the lab while baxter has received its share of praise some media coverage has asked whether the robot could eventually take jobs from humans but brooks sees baxter as a tool comparing the robot to another useful invention the electric drill electric drills increase the productivity of workers but do they take jobs away i view baxter as a tool like the electric drill that increases productivity he says baxter is not technology separate from average workers it s a tool for factory

exchange program with cambridge university england course vi is pleased to participate in the cambridge mit undergraduate exchange program cme and encourages sophomores to consider spending their junior year studying electrical engineering or computer science at cambridge university in england websites to check out include cambridge mit exchange university of cambridge cambridge england mit news office oct article titled cambridge mit exchange funding extended bp funding allows program to expand to students annually from currently cambridge mit underground tutor both cambridge university s engineering department and its computer lab provide a very different style of undergraduate education focused much more on independent study with individual supervision the various colleges at cambridge provide a beautiful and more relaxed environment with time for personal pursuits the quality of the education is excellent and we accept students accomplishments there for department requirements so that students who complete a normal load there will receive full credit for their work and not be at all behind in their degree progress arrangements may also be made so that exchange students can take hass classes and satisfy hass requirements students interested in admission to meng will be considered with their work at cambridge included so that they can learn of their admission before the beginning of their senior year applicants will need a gpa of at least to be accepted to the exchange program and at least b s in basic course vi requirements like and cambridge programs are sufficiently different that no one to one correspondence of classes is possible no grades will be given for classes taken at cambridge students will receive the normal transfer credit grade of s in the engineering department each module successfully completed will earn mit units and the two projects together will earn units a typical load would be four modules in the lent term four modules in the michaelmas term and the two projects in the easter term for a total of units of mit cme credit additional modules undertaken by students in foreign languages humanities or in other departments at cambridge would earn additional mit units beyond the cme credit depending on the work completed exchange students typically satisfy mit eecs departmental requirements for one or two foundational and one or two header subjects two advanced undergraduate subjects and a department lab with remaining units serving as electives why should students consider going to cambridge for their junior year cambridge university is one of the best most beautiful and famous universities in the entire world attending it will set you apart both from other course vi students and from other american students as mit is the only us university with an undergraduate exchange program with cambridge graduate programs including mit s and employers are very impressed by this credential it offers a radically different style of education that complements mit s more structured style very well participants will learn to take more responsibility for their own education and are usually stronger students when they return to mit at cambridge students have time to devote to non academic pursuits and to reflect on their education and other issues it s a complete change of pace from mit no problem sets or quizzes the physical social and cultural environment is very different from mit it s beautiful you can live in an eighteenth century castle or a modern twentieth century hall as you prefer there are over different colleges each with its own culture and style you ll meet amazing people who are very different from mit students their terms are only eight weeks long followed by a six week break so you have time to travel all over england and europe it will give you a new perspective on mit and education what are the drawbacks to spending a year at cambridge you ll be at mit for a year less they don t have urop during the terms it s very different which requires both social and academic adjustments it could make it harder to do a minor or double major you ll miss your friends here but they will love coming to visit you for many students the opportunity to experience something very different but of equal quality academically will be a wonderful accent to their mit education as well as their personal and social development mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

graduate program research interests faculty non faculty supervisors academic information who s teaching what program objectives masterworks meng faqshare what are the meng program requirements an faq introduction what is the meng program the m eng program is a five or five and a half year program that enables you to get your bachelors and masters degree in course vi simultaneously or in sequence you can think of it as a four year bachelors degree and a two year masters condensed through advanced planning and integration joining m eng gives course vi undergraduates the advantages of being able to work on a thesis project being able to take more classes especially advanced graduate ones and study their field in more depth it can also be useful to have a masters degree rather than just a bachelors degree before one enters industry or applies for doctoral programs in this document the details of the graduate portion of the m eng program will be explained background why is the m eng program so complex when the program was designed the intent was to make the process of combining the two degrees smooth and transparent unfortunately the reality is not quite that simple describing a few of the reasons for this will help explain some of the complexities in the program students are one reason the program has become less transparent many students want to get their bachelors after four years instead of waiting until they have completed their masters for some this is because they want to walk with their class at commencement while others have parents who want them to have a degree after four years there are also students who choose to defer m eng and go to work for which they need their bachelors students are not the only reason why this program s implementation is not simple the institute adds quite a bit of complexity to the program the rest of mit has quite strict separations between undergraduate and graduate students with the exception of a few basic things once you become a grad student different processes and rules govern your education having a hybrid program that combines undergraduate and graduate study does not conform to the basic structure of mit the graduate meng program what is undergraduate vs graduate status the purpose of this document is to give the details of the graduate portion of m eng and thus the undergraduate requirements will not be discussed if you need more information on them please go to the undergraduate programs curriculum the m eng program takes an additional two or three semesters or possibly four if you ta one or more terms at least in your last regular semester you must be an official graduate student since becoming a graduate student means you transfer to being a new category of student with different institute rules the institute does not let students switch their status back and forth you are therefore not allowed to switch back to being an undergraduate once you declare yourself a grad student if you have not received your bachelors degree when you become a grad student you have both statuses you are both an undergraduate and a graduate student the graduate status has more weight and thus if there are conflicts in the rules the graduate rules usually apply if you have both statuses you are still eligible for eight terms of undergrad housing once you have received a bachelor of science degree and no longer have undergraduate status you can no longer urop or live in undergraduate housing how does one become a graduate m eng student the process for becoming a grad student once you re admitted to m eng is simple all you have to do is send email to anne hunter indicating for which term you wish to become a graduate student when should one become a graduate meng student if a student has a source of graduate funding and is far enough along with the requirements he or she will often choose to become a grad student in the fourth year eighth term you must have at least units beyond the girs and all but one or two of the girs completed to become a grad student early you do not have to have completed all of the requirements for your undergraduate degree besides funding another reason to become a grad student earlier than the fifth year is to be able to get the meng early at the end of that term as you need to be a graduate student at least one regular i e not summer or iap semester to get the masters there are also a few students who choose to become a graduate student later than the beginning of the fifth year generally this happens when students have a source of funding that requires them to be only an undergraduate or if they are behind in their requirements what about funding one important component of the grad years is funding and registration they very much go hand in hand since the type of funding you have as a graduate student determines what you can register for of course if you pay your own tuition or have support that doesn t go through mit at all none of this applies there are two major sources of

graduate program research interests faculty non faculty supervisors academic information who s teaching what program objectives masterworks interview with meng student kanjun qiushare what were your interests as a high school student and how did you come to choose course when you came to mit in high school i loved math and art and music but was never really exposed to computer science i started at mit as a math major uncertain about what i wanted to do with my life when i looked around it seemed that knowing how to program was necessary for every field and so i switched over to course in retrospect this was not a great reason to choose a major choose something you love and not necessarily something you think is most practical i ve seen peers choose the practical option and graduate unsatisfied but i was one of the fortunate ones who happened to discover a love for computer science and the way it interacts with math and the awesome things you can create with it once you decided to major in course what led you to choose i found out that i greatly preferred algorithms and software design to circuits and signal processing so the choice was fairly obvious that being said one great thing about course is that you can graduate with a deep understanding of how computer systems work in their entirety from the plug in the wall outlet to the cpu the operating system the programs even the wireless routing and communication the computer is a magical machine that s everywhere and we usually take for granted the fact that it somehow works but course breaks down that assumption and takes it apart and you leave mit with an idea of how all the pieces of technological magic in the world work together and how to manipulate them and that s really powerful what are the aspects of and the meng program you liked the best and how have you found your interests grow or change as you ve gone on the meng is wonderful because it gives you a year to do all of the things you wanted to do during undergrad but never had time to due to classes meetings and endless problem sets i had much more time during my meng year i finally got a chance to sleep normally have a reasonable social life take advantage of the classes offered through the student art association become serious about ballroom dance go to random interesting talks and thoroughly learn class material instead of just rushing to finish the next pset days were still chaotic and i was still busy but there s much less pressure and much more room to explore where do you envision yourself headed next and how do you think and the meng program has prepared you mit does a pretty good job of putting us all through enough grueling work that by graduation we feel like no matter what problems are thrown at us we ll figure them out however the meng really taught me how to manage longer term projects and goals and figure out how to deal with long term stress something that s missing in undergrad where we focus on when the next problem set is due usually tomorrow maybe even tonight and where both stress and relief are very immediate but you can t just write a thesis at the last minute so i learned to plan and set goals for myself and force myself to meet those goals because it s easy to ignore and push back your self set goals when there are no consequences for missing them these are really useful skills in the real world where many goals are quite long term and require a good deal of planning and forward looking vision as for where i m headed next i enjoy working at small places where i can do lots of things quickly my current thesis work focuses on education and technology see here for more info http video mit edu watch kanjun qiu expanding the culture of computing and i hope to continue my work in the field as a side project after graduation in the past i ve done a lot of algorithmic trading which i like because lots of things get done quickly and i will likely pursue trading for a few years but i believe that as privileged mit students we are fortunate enough to be given important skills and powerful knowledge and there are tons of domains out there with many people who don t have our privilege and who are sorely in need of our skills and knowledge u s education and women s issues in underdeveloped countries being two that i care a lot about while i don t know where i ll be in five or ten years perhaps i ll find myself somewhere in those domains mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

computer science dept graduate student kuang xu is featured by the mit news office for his work balancing the technicality of real world engineering needs with the elegance of applying mathematics to arrive at solutions that are profoundly powerful his current focus is how to alleviate hospital emergency room backups read more in the aug mit news office article by mit news correspondent jessica fujimori titled from theory to practice phd student kuang xu has found a way to apply predictive modeling to improve emergency room wait times posted below in its entirety while long lines repel some people they intrigue mit phd student kuang xu after all maybe there s a way to reduce such lengthy waits a native of suzhou china who enjoys rock climbing and ballroom dancing xu earned his bachelor s degree in electrical engineering from the university of illinois at urbana champaign in and arrived at mit in september of that year since coming to mit xu has studied queuing networks that include stochastic or random dynamics with his advisor john tsitsiklis the clarence j lebel professor of electrical engineering and computer science in work beginning with his master s thesis xu has shown that having even a little flexibility in resources drastically improves wait times for example xu says in call centers you just need to train your staff so that each person speaks a few languages or knows a few disciplines if they are mixed and matched in a smart way then together they are very powerful a few years ago xu saw himself becoming an engineer but his interests have since shifted i started from engineering and slowly evolved into a more mathematical kind of blend xu says i like the idea that math is a juncture between practical impact and elegant ideas you see something that s very conceptual but if you know how to tweak it the right way it will have very profound practical applications xu s current work reflects this application of theoretical concepts to real world problems in his case overcrowding in emergency rooms emergency forecasts adding some flexibility to services is just one way to improve wait times what if there were a way to know ahead of time how many people would be arriving and when it turns out that in the flexible system we considered if you know a little bit about the future it brings you tremendous improvement even on top of what you already have with this flexibility xu says i anticipate so i vacate a resource earlier on so i can essentially smooth out the process the next step was to find a setting where researchers could get that information about the future and use it effectively xu was at a conference presenting his work on flexibility when he saw a presentation by carri chan an assistant professor of decision risk and operations at columbia university who works on improving wait times in hospitals the kind of setting that xu had been looking for i talked to her and she said wait a minute this future information is not impossible to get in health care settings xu says so we started looking into it tackling wait times in the er has long been a challenge xu says in emergency rooms you re typically overloaded all the time if you look at the statistics of the u s average waiting time the total average time is on the order of a few hours a lot of people leave without being seen by a doctor because they just get frustrated using predictive parameters such as the day of the week and weather conditions from models built by others xu s algorithm improves wait times by percent which translates to approximately minutes less time on average spent in an er s waiting room though xu emphasizes that the work is still ongoing his results so far have been promising i could be solving a computer problem which is still important but the ability to possibly save some lives and improve health care by a little bit could be very profound xu says educational efforts ever since his undergraduate days at illinois where he founded a research program for underclassmen that was inspired by mit s undergraduate research opportunities program urop xu has been passionate about education when he heard about mitx he immediately wanted to take part currently xu is working with tsitsiklis to record recitation and tutorial videos for the anticipated launch of x a class on probability additionally as a member of the mit council on educational technology and the institute wide task force on the future of mit education xu helps facilitate graduate student involvement in online education i m very curious about how digital technology can empower interaction and learning among people xu says i think the digital learning movement could be very powerful after he earns his phd xu hopes to combine his passions for

connector alumni in eecs connector remember this student groups ashar aziz share founder vice chairman of the board and chief strategy officer fireeye inc growing up in pakistan ashar aziz at a young age had a goal to be a technologist and an inventor and entrepreneur when he learned from one of his cousins that mit was the best engineering school in the world he decided that would be the best way to reach his goal but he didn t actually know how to apply directly to mit something that was not common knowledge in his country i heard through the grapevine that if you went to a certain school in turkey the middle east technical university in ankura also known as metu and you did well there you could transfer to mit he said fortunately the information was correct he applied to metu and went there for two years transferring finally to mit in his junior year aziz looks back noting about his unusual entry to mit that it was a curious journey but not one that was uncommon in those days on completing his sb in in electrical engineering aziz earned an m s in computer science from the university of california berkeley where he also received the u c regents fellowship he then went to work at sun microsystems where for twelve years his work focused on networking and network security aziz s first company called terraspring inc was founded in a data center automation and virtualization company terraspring inc was acquired in by sun microsystems aziz served as chief technology officer until october throughout this period he was building patents in the field of cryptography networking network security and data center virtualization lessons learned to define a new problem and aziz was setting out to learn from his first startup experience so he could launch into his next his thinking work backwards from a problem to a novel solution making the solution easy to deploy and to use and making it track the problem trajectory much better than existing solutions making it truly disruptive in the market these are just some of the lessons i learned during my first startup aziz then began his quest for an interesting and very hard problem to solve one that the world was going to have to confront he found the problem description in the u s department of defense archives proposals that were soliciting for answers to solve the problem related to highly stealthy self propagating malware the more i studied the problem the more i was convinced this would be a defining problem in the st century aziz says he also realized on continued examination of this problem that the fast evolution of the malware threat was going to make all current efforts obsolete aziz determined that the solution was to develop a brand new defensive architecture blueprint his extensive work culminated in fireeye inc and its product portfolio the last years have massively validated the cyber security problem the failure of traditional approaches and the efficacy of the solution i developed says aziz who founded the company in the core of the fireeye platform is a virtual execution engine complemented by dynamic threat intelligence to identify and block cyber attacks in real time and across the different stages of an attack life cycle aziz noted in an online interview in our goal is to bolster the security and key infrastructure that is pervasive across financial government and credit card infrastructure to protect from three very important threats crime espionage and warfare aziz noted these are not one off failures in say google or juniper or adobe it s a systemic fault in enterprise security architecture the reality is everybody can go down at any point in time and the majority are vulnerable building the disruptive technology that works as aziz shared with the students in start the iap workshop for innovators and entrepreneurs held in mid january finding the disruptive technology that answers a large and growing need makes it possible for even a small startup to gain significant market interest in a short time as cyber attacks increased and the large incumbent dominant providers were not coming up with the solutions the market for a less known company but one that could solve the security problems led to fireeye s recognition and success he noted that building the team for a company means finding high quality talent which he says is rare when he built fireeye s team he was fortunate to recruit a technical team that he already knew from his previous startup what is he looking for in recruiting fire passion the desire to make a difference and not being satisfied with the status quo he says and he shared with the responsive group of start engineering and management students advice based on his experience before you even have an idea think about how you construct it backwards from the problem once you have reverse engineered the solution he continued you have to validate it with a potential customer he cautions that it should not be something that represents an incremental change to an existing product but something out of the box uniquely addressing the problem in ways that make the solution value proposition significantly better than anything that the incumbent market can offer from there the job is to get investors as he puts it raising the money is getting a ticket to the game but figuring out how to win the game is the most important thing he tops off this advice with you need to have courage because when things

connector alumni in eecs connector remember this student groups robert blumofe sm phd share executive vice president platform division akamai technologies inc robert bobby blumofe admits that his predecessors did not provide math science role models my father was in charge of production at united artists and then director of the american film institute west on the other side my mother s father was jack benny but when his older half brother was an undergraduate at stanford taking computer science courses bobby at age picked up programming on his hp calculator and things clicked teaching himself basic he wrote programs for fun in elementary school although he was a tinkerer with radio controlled airplanes and the like his programming went on hold until he was an undergraduate at brown university at brown blumofe returned to programming learning c and more languages ultimately earning a spot in the graphics research group of prof andreis andy van dam the thomas j watson jr university professor blumofe had his first experience with research and writing reasonably large scale programs and he credits andy with playing an important role in pointing him in the direction of mit during a year away from brown andy got bobby a job as a programmer at a local startup in providence called cadre technologies there bobby was taken into the fold working with the founder lou mazzuchelli and a talented group i got a ton of great experience and i value those friendships to this day he says that turned out to be an amazing experience super focused on his return to brown blumofe got back into math and theory including a class taught by jeff vitter who taught from manuscripts by don knuth for his book concrete math although challenged by this material with persistence bobby gained satisfaction while studying the proofs and solving problems there s amazing creativity and elegance in complexity theory and the analysis of algorithms he notes he was hooked and continued with theory classes even reading research papers on graduating from brown bobby blumofe was still not set on graduate school or mit he could have been happy returning to cadre technologies and had little confidence in getting accepted but his growing interest in theory and research was enough to convince him to apply to stanford and mit accepted to both blumofe credits his references clearly andy van dam jeff vitter and lou mazzuchelli wrote some great letters for me and i m forever grateful what tipped his decision blumofe says my decision to go to mit over stanford was largely driven by what i found in visiting the two maybe it was just timing but at mit visiting the theory group there was an energy level of activity and collaboration that i didn t see at stanford it was really exciting to think that i could be part of that activity working with these people solving problems and writing papers blumofe reflects mit is intense it s high energy it s in your face not necessarily for everyone but more than anything it s the most incredibly talented group of people that i ve ever come across in fact he found all these things at mit and notes that he found it important to balance with another activity like a hobby or sport he got into hockey even though he had never played before because the theory group had an active intramural team tom cormen who was just completing his work on the textbook introduction to algorithms along with professor charles leiserson convinced him to start playing this turned out to be a good thing as blumofe made a number of friendships through hockey including his now wife cynthia breazeal then a graduate student in the ai lab their friendship blossomed years later and they now have three sons read about cynthia in this issue page he also worked with charles leiserson his advisor as a graduate student in the theory group he says about him charles is all energy all enthusiasm all the time and i ve never met anyone who cares more about the development of his students than charles he loves what he does he loves his colleagues and students and it shows when you re working with charles it always feels like whatever you re working on is the most important most impactful most interesting and coolest thing that anyone could possibly be working on blumofe notes that leiserson s attention to detail rubbed off not only teaching him about research and problem solving but how to write and present ideas and solutions skills he uses daily in his professional life down the road at akamai technologies bobby blumofe joined akamai in august when the company was about months old he says his decision had to do with the people namely tom leighton akamai s founder and now ceo and blumofe s former teacher and reader on his thesis and the other people were equal pulls including charles leiserson and bruce maggs then vp of engineering at akamai although he knew akamai at the time had something to do with large scale distributed systems using theory and algorithms to solve large scale problems he knew that he wanted to work with this group of people i knew that so long as i stayed near these people that great things would happen although he is no longer developing algorithms or proving theorems bobby uses the problem solving skills every day as an executive at akamai i learned how to analyze a complex system find useful abstractions that focus attention on the core elements that drive the system

electrical engineering and computer science department for years as well as founder of the bose corporation in every sunday morning vanu remembers coming to play badminton with his father and a group of faculty and students an enduring early vision of what mit was about he also has fond memories of the mit day camp especially sailing on the charles river and seeing his father s new office in the brand new ultramodern building while at mit as an undergraduate and then graduate student starting in vanu recalls the unique opportunities that he found there to meet and talk to so many famous company founders i remember meeting ken olsen of dec as a grad student when i presented to the eecs visiting committee he notes his advisor introduced him to the late teradyne founder alex d arbeloff who shared his experiences with vanu over coffee vanu also met analog devices co founder and then ceo ray stata and was an eecs graduate student with stata s son raymie now ceo of altiscale i think it s a unique part of the mit experience that there are not only so many great founders around but that they make themselves accessible vanu says creating wireless coverage where it doesn t exist vanu bose founded vanu inc in pioneering the commercialization of software defined radio and the first company to receive fcc certification of a software defined radio in as ceo of vanu inc vanu says about the direction of his company we ve had to learn the hard way to shift focus from technology to solving customer problems our mission is to create solutions for places that don t have good wireless coverage today he notes that today s technology works well and is cost effective where carriers build the coverage the equipment however doesn t get built where it is not cost effective including inside buildings in rural areas in developing areas and on ships so vanu inc plies a variety of solutions not just for the communication technology but also in the business models and power usage to make it viable to provide this coverage in a jan interview with ranjani saigal for the e magazine lokvani vanu talked about the efforts his company is making to bridge these gaps in wireless coverage in the developing world in rural areas and world wide vanu noted that the most common issue in the developing world is lack of power if you look at it there are about billion people in the world today that don t have cellular coverage simply because they don t have electricity some areas he reports run on up to gallons of diesel a year expensive and environmentally unsound so vanu inc has developed a compact base station requiring only watts rather than the traditional kw the product called compact ran and weighing only pounds is sealed and requires no installation at per unit it is the cheapest outdoor base station on the market today vanu notes further for areas in africa where cell phones are used and need to be charged this unit the compact ran in combination with a meter pole specially rigged with solar panels can provide gsm cellular and wi fi hotspot coverage with a cell phone charging station at the base of the pole so now you can charge your cellphone you can use cellular and you can access the internet all from this one little kiosk in the middle of the village vanu says in the rural us vanu says his company has created a business model and network architecture by launching a wholesale network through a subsidiary company we don t have subscribers we re not a carrier but any carrier can connect to our network and pays us a rate per minute and megabyte that s transferred over our network vanu said in fact worldwide vanu hopes to provide complete coverage in roughly five years as for developing world impact he notes to ranjani saigal for lokvani i strongly believe that a good business model is needed to make a viable impact that sustains over time he adds of course it is always nice to see the social impact that comes as a by product creating entrepreneurship opportunities vanu bose has taken an interest in helping mit eecs students gain more access to entrepreneurship opportunities both through involvement with eecs faculty serving on the board of the gordon mit engineering leadership program and as a member of the mt corporation as well as offering his time as a panelist and moderator for the eecs department s workshop on entrepreneurship and innovation start he notes entrepreneurship is by nature a grass roots effort often during efforts that others think are crazy in fact he continues if you are doing something that everyone thinks is a good idea then it s not innovative it s obvious vanu suggests mit has a great grass roots entrepreneurship community the mit venture mentoring service vms is a tremendous resource as are various student groups and clubs but i don t think anyone at any university has figured out how to really create a more formal process for fostering entrepreneurship and that is the challenge

movie star wars i was fascinated by the droids r d and c po breazeal felt robots were not only intelligent and capable but also social and emotive with rich personalities and capable of forging meaningful relationships with people robots for me should always have intelligence with heart and they should engage with us like devoted sidekicks instead of just tools or slaves our experience with technology should reinforce what we love about the human experience not dehumanize us this is her enduring vision when it came time for her to think about her future she first wanted to be a doctor typical at that time for girls who were serious about their futures and interested in science in terms of gender issues she notes i am fortunate that i have not encountered roadblocks on my career path because of my gender it starts at home she says where she was raised with the expectation and confidence that she could do anything that she set her mind to both her parents were career scientists being aware of the great job opportunities in stem related fields her parents encouraged her to pursue them so she worked summers at the lawrence livermore national lab where her mother worked as an undergraduate at the university of california santa barbara breazeal realized with some parental encouragement that majoring in engineering would keep her options more open than premed later she decided she wanted to be an astronaut a mission specialist which meant getting a phd in a relevant field space robotics was a natural choice and she applied for graduate programs accordingly at the time that she was accepted to mit to work in the artificial intelligence lab with rod brooks in the early s he had just published his seminal work advocating for small autonomous micro rovers for planetary exploration fast cheap and out of control a robot invasion of the solar system rod s ideas about autonomous microrovers she notes were very influential for nasa s sojourner program which came about in reality hit breazeal when she arrived at brooks ai lab i remember my first day walking into rod brooks lab and seeing all the autonomous robots scurrying about or not all inspired by insect intelligence she recalls it was as if my first moment of watching star wars on the big screen came flooding over me all over again at that moment i knew that if we were ever going to see real robots like r d and c po it was going to happen in this lab from that point on breazeal didn t want to be an astronaut she wanted to make the dream of her childhood robots a reality rod brooks support ranged from intellectual and creative freedom to credit that helped build her reputation in the field even while she was a graduate student rod is the one who taught me how to be a thought leader and a visionary she notes he told her that no matter how big the field people get stuck in a rut making the same assumptions he recommended find that rut change yourself and change it and create a new movement which she is doing with social robotics in fact she credits rod brooks for his support of the women in his group when she first joined his group women actually outnumbered the men few people know what a strong proponent rod has been to women in the field look at the women leaders in robotics today many were either rod s former students or students of his students she notes breazeal also credits anita flynn who was a staff research scientist in rod s lab when she first joined the group breazeal describes her as one of the most high energy positive thinking creative tech savvy people she knows she says for anita robotics was a family sport everyone pitches in everyone helps everyone else because that s what a family does breazeal has emulated her positive impact by setting the same culture in her own group the personal robotics group in the mit media lab where she is associate professor at the time of this writing breazeal is on professional leave from mit and is founder and chief scientist at her new company jibo inc the company is dedicated to bringing social robots to the mass consumer market toward that goal they are developing the first open social robotics platform and the world s first family robot named jibo in fact as she gave the keynote for the first women in innovation and entrepreneurship networking reception held in connection with start the eecs iap workshop for entrepreneurs and innovators she announced that she had just closed a series a funding of million the press announcement was the day before on jan for her company the world will be a better place with more women entrepreneurs she shared to an enthusiastic group cynthia breazeal is speaking at this event on january at the mit media lab in the photo above photo credit john gillooly professional event images inc she says jibo is the meta of my work at mit and of the field of social robotics her insight is that while most people think of robots doing physical things her research and labs worldwide have shown that social robots are a powerful technology for human engagement making greater emotional and social impact than current flat screened gadget

brother applied to mit when he mike was in the sixth grade i distinctly remember sitting in the back seat of our car listening to my mother talking to him about it she said if you go to mit you can do anything in the world growing up evans noticed that mit was often part of movies he watched and in science fiction books once on campus he was fascinated by the idea of combining disciplines from the impressive number of top rated programs such as the interface of mechanical and electrical engineering and computer science evans mit light bulb moment hit in a science technology and society class he realized never before in the history of humanity has a single individual been so in control of the means of creating value as a software developer in the heady idea that he could bring ideas all the way to market entirely based on his own skills and efforts came to him during the dotcom boom and in his last semester when he studied acoustics with dr amar bose the final sequence of lectures that focused on the financial engineering behind the bose corporation became for evans an inspiring reality check in successful management in and evans notes almost the entire campus was thinking about entrepreneurship the k competition had just launched at the ai lab akamai had just been founded and the media lab was just getting going there was a lot of entrepreneurial energy rather than making a big course correction however the institute treated this as the newest incarnation of a long history of innovation engagement looked much like it had for years individual professor and individual students meeting in an ecosystem that encourages experimentation and risktaking after graduating mike worked for three years as a software developer as the dotcom bubble burst while his technical skills developed he fed his craving to understand how management in a larger company handled its employees he saw how his boss who valued and protected his people created an effective team dynamic evans also noticed how hr worked to limit liability rather than maximize employee potential all the while his engineering mind kept asking can this be done better how would i break the challenges of creating a culture into smaller pieces and tackle them individually this thinking was supported by an engineering lesson he had learned a key principle of engineering is questioning things that have always been done that way also during this stretch evans says his actual hunger such as ordering pizza downtown began to bug him he was coding late at night and wanted to order food online he wondered why it could be featured in the movie the net in but not exist in so mit trained in the art of all nighters he wrote the first version of grubhub the following morning his co founder matt maloney sold a restaurant and by that afternoon evans had quit his job by day they had signed up eight restaurants when a restaurant owner asked evans if they had coupons on the site he said yes and proceeded to pull another all nighter to write the coupon functionality signing up two more restaurants with the coupons the following morning he notes today this methodology is called the lean startup movement at the time he just thought of it as an engineering problem to be solved step build a product step sell it step profit evans and maloney bootstrapped their business for three years before taking venture capital when they did take vc they took it as much to learn from institutional investors as to finance the growth of the company evans says about this time each stage of growth brought challenges and each round of vc brought new expertise to help us meet those challenges internally we added experts in fields i had never encountered before sales marketing operations and customer service i learned as much from our employees as i did from our investors from the first day evans and maloney were solving challenging problems at grubhub each solution led to another opportunity to create a better discover ordering and fulfillment opportunity sometimes they used technology other times process optimization still other times education of restaurants and customers each innovation represented change but throughout all of that change one thing remained constant making delivery better for the customer following the grubhub ipo in spring evans decided to hand over the company reigns this was a time he describes as critical to centering himself following the intensity of the previous years at grubhub it was also a time he used to figure out what would come next although he says he totally failed at that goal more like letting it gel he did splash his bicycle tire in the atlantic at virginia beach and ride miles across the country reaching the pacific days later he describes this journey and more on his blog http mikeevans co he said for this feature i succeeded in an unexpected way i discovered that people are amazing across miles and over a thousand interactions with people on my trip i overwhelmingly experienced kindness graciousness and generosity in a characteristic engineer s approach he notes that if the hour news cycle was representative of how people actually act we d be watching hours and minutes of acts of kindness with minutes of all the other garbage besides listing

in eecs connector remember this student groups andrea wong share it s a great time to be in television andrea wong grew up in silicon valley attending the high school that steve jobs and steve wozniak went to technology was all around her i was a good math student so everyone told me that i should be an engineer i wanted to go to the best school possible and mit was it though she is used to working hard andrea says that studying electrical engineering at mit was the hardest she ever worked in her life she says about her training i think every woman or girl who is even remotely interested in science should get an engineering degree because it trains your mind when you walk away from mit it just trains you to break down very difficult problems while she was at mit andrea wong never questioned that she would be an engineer so it took her a while to figure out that she could do something else but once she did she realized she could do anything she started at an investment bank as a financial analyst followed by a job at pepsico both positions allowed her to master the fundamentals of business and professionalism from this point however andrea knew that to reach a really fulfilling career she needed to focus on what she was passionate about for her that meant what people do for entertainment how people relax and escape how they use their leisure time and income shaping her ideal life s work took the kind of analytic and focused attention that she had built during her mit experience while gaining her mba at stanford graduate school of business andrea explored the worlds of entertainment travel and leisure and food and wine i talked to anyone in those fields that would give me ten minutes and read everything about those industries andrea fell in love with tv news when she got a summer job at nbc so when she graduated from stanford in she decided to start all over again at the bottom of abc news as a production associate making less money than she made in her first job out of mit but she climbed the ladder from there she also made use of her thorough exploration of entertainment as she built her career at abc as executive vice president of alternative programming specials and late night andrea developed hit shows such as the bachelor the u s version of dancing with the stars and the emmy award winning extreme makeover home edition again the discipline she gained at mit played a key role but with a twist in engineering at mit she explains you re trained to take a whole bunch of complex issues and solve them down to an answer but when i went into the creative world i had to train my brain to do exactly the opposite take a kernel of an idea and grow it into a show in terms of technology s impact andrea notes that technology is making tv more powerful every day because it is allowing people to consume more and more content how and when they want in wong followed her multiple contributions at abc taking a new position as president and ceo of lifetime networks where she quickly guided the company to strong ratings with shows like the top rated original series army wives and project runway both of these shows were the highest rated series on lifetime she also oversaw the development of digital experiences aimed as a destination for women online today and since fall andrea is the president of international production for sony pictures television spt and international president for sony pictures entertainment in her spt position andrea oversees the studio s international television production business including eighteen owned and joint venture production companies around the world as the global tv audience continues to expand andrea is also exploring content creation for a wide range of geographic and cultural diversity she says one of the most exciting things about my job right now is that i get to make tv all over the world we make comedies in russia we make talk shows game shows and tele novellas in the middle east we make tele series in colombia and mexico it s endlessly interesting on her way to stockholm she points to the potential tv markets not only in scandinavia but also in india china south africa and eventually in australia how is it possible to relate to all these varied markets andrea says there are certain things that resonate or provoke people and the best global hit tv shows tap into that and that allows great shows to travel around the world for example she continues we own who wants to be a millionaire this show has been in countries it resonates because it s about betting on your own knowledge and it s something that is universal although she is responsible for overseeing content creation companies worldwide regardless of technology platforms andrea s electrical engineering background has meant a lot in terms of her awareness of the benefits of constantly evolving technologies she notes that although technology may occasionally provide a degree of freedom creatively such as interactivity technology developments provide more opportunity for distribution paired with her love for her work andrea credits her success to the fearlessness that she got from her mit engineering education the greatest thing i got out of that education was i have absolutely no fear about solving problems because i will never solve harder problems than i did on a daily basis

in eecs connector remember this student groups bill thies meng phd share when the alternative path is the right path bill thies was a top student at the end of undergrad he had a perfect gpa and a world of opportunities when he graduated from mit with his phd in computer science in bill was at the top of his field with tenure track faculty offers from stanford and berkeley he was also interested in a dramatically different alternative to live in india and develop technology to impact global disparities in health education and livelihood how and why he made this choice is the perfect story that follows as an undergraduate bill was seeking ways to learn about developing countries the question was how to find the resources at mit to help in this search coincidentally he learned about a lecture series run by eecs prof saman amarasinghe on disseminating health information in remote rural areas in fact michael dertouzos then lcs director spoke at this event about the lab s commitment to targeting technology for the benefit of global health and well being bill notes about this convergence i was stunned not only by the resonance with my interests but by a divine coincidence saman was already supervising my urop on an unrelated topic herein was born the greatest gift that mit would offer me a deep connection with a mentor and role model who championed my personal development for almost a decade things moved quickly after that without hesitation or applying to other graduate schools bill enrolled for his phd at mit continuing with prof amarasinghe soon bill traveled with him to explore opportunities in sri lanka and india where new technology could have an impact on poor communities he notes saman already knew the ropes both as a native of sri lanka and as founder of the first internet service provider in the country for bill everything in india and sri lanka was new and unfamiliar to get his feet wet bill helped in the development of several projects including time equals knowledge tek an email based search tool for users in low connectivity environments in collaboration with lcs affiliate libby levison and many students they deployed this tool and logged usage from diverse individuals students farmers even priests in remote areas out of internet reach although he says it was gratifying to have a taste of technology s impact in these surroundings bill recalls the development of his thinking the more we worked to enable information retrieval in developing regions the more we realized that the most profound unmet need was not in consuming information but in producing information the internet took off only with the rise of user generated content facebook youtube twitter where everyone has a voice and a global audience for a low literate farmer in rural india owning a basic mobile phone and speaking only the local language producing content may have very different meaning a number of questions followed can we give this population a voice and will an international audience listen can farmers leverage this ability to improve their daily lives with saman s group bill helped build a prototype of an audio wiki an interactive voice response ivr system to enable callers to both record and listen to audio content in audio format the content became accessible to low income populations without smart phones or internet connectivity or even literacy this prototype was launched in india in as a real world deployment called cgnet swara http cgnetswara org cgnet swara provided a new way for rural citizens and social activists to voice news grievances and cultural stories that otherwise would go unnoticed soon urban activists government actors and members of the mainstream media were monitoring the system amending many of the problems that were voiced to date cgnet swara has released about messages and has received about calls from listeners many reports have had a documented impact on rural communities for example reported bribes have been returned lost wages have been paid and overdue services have been delivered every impact story is detailed on the cgnet swara website bill s attraction to work in india was also based on his joining a team for the mit ideas competition and the yunus challenge to alleviate poverty the focus of the challenge that year was to improve adherence to tuberculosis medications the group led by manish bhardwaj sm phd developed a low cost electronic pillbox to monitor and improve medication adherence winning the challenge and earning recognition in other collegiate business competitions opened up many doors for the team bill notes about this milestone the most important outcome of our entry was not the technology which met with difficulties during deployment but our exposure to the problem domain as part of the challenge manish and i traveled to india and saw the impediments to rural healthcare delivery first hand when the time came to graduate bill could have taken a faculty position in the united states building on his dissertation research in programming languages and compilers the other choice was to take a position at the new bangalore branch of microsoft research msr the interdisciplinary group at msr india aimed to apply technology to the needs and aspirations of poor communities a focus that resonated for bill and kentaro toyama the founder of this group was deeply inspiring to him the decision though difficult was obvious moving to india in allowed bill and the yunus challenge team to bring their ideas to real world impact using his knowledge of tb in india bill worked with operation asha to develop a new system

in eecs connector remember this student groups conor madigan phdshare founding kateeva to put flexible and large size oleds in the mainstream if you had the choice to be a professor in electrical engineering at potentially any major university or to start a manufacturing company to produce a new high technology product that would be at the forefront of a new industry what would be your choice conor madigan is a thorough kind of person especially when it comes to decisions this particular choice in his career came as he completed his phd in under prof vladimir bulovic and was working as a postdoc on printing oled materials for low cost scalable manufacturing his decision required careful thought and a bit of time fortunately good faculty positions at that time were hard to find working with his colleagues eecs graduate students gerry chen who was advised by bulovic and valerie gassend then valerie leblanc who was advised by prof marty schmidt brought madigan the satisfaction of returning to work that was related to several projects he had enjoyed as an undergraduate at princeton under prof jim sturm he had learned at the time that he was fascinated by working with oled science and engineering and one of these two projects ironically involved inkjet printing to produce oled so conor madigan took advantage of his long association with vladimir bulovic to discuss his career choices following his postdoc the two had met at princeton when vladimir was finishing his own postdoc and preparing to start his new lab as a faculty member at mit he invited and convinced conor to come to mit as one of his two new graduate students with seth coe sullivan madigan jumped in to build the bulovic lab in the summer of in madigan found his answer to his career choice was increasingly weighted towards building a new company developing his startup pitch deck was an exciting process and jumping into two business classes at the sloan school got him closer to his choice by late he asked vladimir marty gerry and valerie to join him in the new company and halted faculty position applications conor s recounting of the steps that led to forming kateeva is an exercise in startup knowhow incorporating kateeva in delaware was as simple as following online instructions in less than a month conor gave the first pitch presentation at the logical starting point a printed electronics investor conference in silicon valley the value of associations instantly kicked in as conor met with dr sass somekh former evp of applied materials and former president of novellus fortuitously arranged through marty schmidt sass is considered a legend in the silicon valley semiconductor equipment industry the architect of key products that made applied materials a b company madigan notes madigan gets excited as he relates the next steps at that first meeting i pitched sass on the idea of forming a company to commercialize our mit technology to enable low cost oled manufacturing he was intrigued sass somekh was not just intrigued following a successful meeting with a potential customer in asia sass joined kateeva as the sixth and final co founder also becoming the executive chairman he held that position until retiring from the kateeva board in mid the key to the kateeva pitch was oled madigan notes oled in early was just getting commercial visibility following earlier hype bust cycles sony s release of an expensive but gorgeous tv that offered better color contrast ratio and viewing angle than lcd and paper thinness and flexibility lower power and ultimately lower cost was perfect timing for madigan s pitch sony s release helped madigan persuade potential investors that by changing the production economics oled could seize the b year flat panel display industry from lcd potentially opening up a b year market opportunity for equipment manufacturers like kateeva following a marathon pitch day with six vc firms all of them requesting additional meetings kateeva accepted a term sheet for a m investment led by a premier vc by the end of april madigan moved to sf closed the mit patent license and the first investment round and kateeva was up and running i was so busy that i never stopped to think that of the things i was doing every day were completely new to me he recollects conor madigan continues to build kateeva through collaboration learning on the fly timing and being ultra nimble in the face of change kateeva s key proprietary inkjet printing technologies were developed through close collaboration with leading oled manufacturers madigan has learned that a startup ceo needs to be ready to do it all though he credits kateeva s steady and speedy growth to the contributions of his team including an engineering brain trust individuals who are passionate about inventing fortunately oled has been growing explosively since now a b a year industry and heavy weight advocates samsung and lg are pushing oled as the display technology of the future kateeva also turned on a dime several years ago successfully rebuilding their printing approach turns out it was a smart move madigan notes about this nimble turn around in kateeva s production technique approach since then we ve executed well we have first prototype systems in the field with first production systems planned for shipment this year photo above kateeva s yieldjet tm platform courtesy kateeva by any measure he continues that s tremendous progress for a complex science based hardware product in such a short time frame beyond that we ve also recently expanded our executive team we recruited alain harrus phd a semiconductor industry

in eecs connector remember this student groups william irving sm meng phd share quantitative theory backs up investment instincts growing up in suburban denver bill irving stood out as a math and science kid for many years in elementary and junior high school i was left to my own devices to learn math and science rather than be bored in class he says this isolation finally abated in the summer before his senior year when he went to the frontiers of science institute at the university of northern colorado following this very affirming experience bill decided to study engineering at mit specifically chemistry followed by medicine as an undergraduate at mit bill irving was struck by two realities how positive he found his experience being part of the chi phi fraternity and how potentially demoralizing it was to keep up with all the brilliant people in his classes fortunately bill s frat brothers remain life long friends and ultimately he found at mit that he was inspired by his very bright classmates and that feeling humbled was not such a bad thing not just about circuits by his sophomore year bill irving was tending towards course vi particularly because of his experiences taking several classes such as al drake s probabilistic systems analysis his eyes were opened by the diversity of course vi it wasn t just about circuits he notes from his doctoral studies his engineering career in battlefield surveillance and even his career in finance bill still relies on the skills he learned in for probabilistic modeling taking alan oppenheim s digital signal processing at the time that compact discs were usurping records as the preferred medium for music storage bill found it really cool that sound could be digitized and then filtered using the techniques taught in the class he also notes prof oppenheim s textbook discrete time signal processing was a masterpiece representing a culmination of many decades of dedicated thought and research estimation theory and cycling through vermont the path to graduate school and beyond following his undergraduate years bill irving worked full time for two years at mit lincoln laboratory his lincoln colleagues rick barnes and dennis blejer were particularly influential rick taught him the essentials of detection and estimation theory and was an enviable master of back of the envelope calculations dennis taught him the essentials of electromagnetic wave theory and also the beauty of cycling through the hills of vermont lincoln lab also fostered bill irving s move back to graduate school by funding his studies through their staff associate program and he continued to work for them during the next five summers back at mit bill joined the laboratory for information and decision systems lids working with professor john tsitsiklis on his masters thesis and with professor alan willsky on his doctoral thesis my graduate career taught me that learning can be a very personal human endeavor initiative and hard work are important but more so are the interactions and collaborations with others with regard to these others my tremendous good fortune was to be surrounded by top notch advisors teachers colleagues and friends from a sea of red ink to performing on radio and television lessons in communication of the skills he developed through his graduate studies bill singles out the value he gained in developing crisp effective communication both written and oral alan willsky used to mark drafts of my papers with a sea of red ink he notes yet through collaboration with his lincoln colleague shawn verbout bill learned that the key to clear writing is painstaking hard work bill irving transitioned from engineering to finance around years ago when he began a new career in the fixed income division of fidelity investments as a quantitative analyst his first job was to build and maintain tools for valuing mortgage backed securities mbs at the time he notes he knew close to nothing about bonds or finance but i was fearless he continues as my mit training had given me a level of confidence that was not easily shaken in fact interacting with traders and portfolio managers who knew the inside jargon did not dissuade him today bill is a portfolio manager at fidelity where he leads a team that manages about billion in fixed income assets mainly mbs bill not only entered the financial world as an mit phd trained engineer but was still getting his boots on the ground when the financial crisis hit i feel like i gained about years of experience in that short turbulent period he notes in fact morningstar nominated one of his mbs funds for bond fund of the year although the fund didn t win he says i was fortunate to survive and emerge smarter and more experienced through this period although nearly years of experience in the market have given bill irving an instinctive feel for how things work he says he can still back this up with a good understanding of the underlying quantitative theory although he rarely develops algorithms anymore he has been a regular in various tv and online interviews you can hear him present his sought after analytically based financial

her brookline ma high school friends coming to mit to hang out soaking up the hacking culture in the process she says her friends were really interested in this new thing called the internet we heard that mit had a connection to it she says so we used to walk into the w cluster log in as root and run mosaic on the sparcs then at night she says she and her friends would go to anime club or lsc she remembers thinking wow this is incredible i wish i was a student here everyone is so smart and there is so much fun stuff to do i want to learn everything there is to know initially a computer science major at boston univeristy fried transferred to mit eecs in her junior year so she could become more involved in electrical engineering by the time she entered the meng program in eecs fried was happiest when she could work late hours assembling electronic devices unique gadgets that she began to sell online while freely sharing her design plans at this stage in her life limor fried had taken on the moniker ladyada after a th century female mathematician and first computer programmer so it was only natural that she named her startup company adafruit industries from then to now since its startup phase adafruit has become a multimillion dollar company that s been called a leader in the open source hardware industry and fried now adafruit s ceo is lauded as a pioneer of the maker movement a rising culture emphasizing do it yourself technology that has proved to be a profitable niche in january fried was named entrepreneur of the year by entrepreneur magazine in she was the first female engineer featured on the cover of wired and was included on fast company s most influential women in technology list in she was awarded a pioneer award by the electronic frontier foundation a digital rights group there are many amazing people working hard and inspiring the maker movement every single day fried says of her tech celebrity status we all have our roles and little parts we can do to make the world a better place through learning and sharing adafruit primarily sells kits of build your own electronic devices complete with open source licenses encouraging customers to modify the final products but its primary focus is on teaching engineering to the world fried says an educational company that just happens to have a gift shop at the end while flattered by the publicity fried hopes her fame across makerdom will help promote science technology engineering and math stem education and show that there s a way to combine a passion for engineering with entrepreneurship i think this represents opportunity for more makers and hackers to see it s possible to be a good cause and a good business she says anyone who wants to help teach people electronics and how to make things can make a business out of it paving the entrepreneurial road at mit nine years ago when fried was still combining her mit graduate student status with launching her startup there was a lot of uncertainty but she kept at it mit with its emphasis on diligence and experimentation became a safe haven mit is a great place to come face to face with what you know and what you don t know and to power through the discomfort of not knowing percent of what you re doing she says many of her creations took place in miters a student run lab stocked with electrical engineering equipment and a great resource for creative engineering fried says there she developed some of her early commercial devices such as the minipov whose led display makes words appear to be floating in air and the minty mp player which fits inside an altoids tin a version of the latter the mintyboost kit an altoids tin based charger for portable devices is now adafruit s best seller with more than units sold fried provided the design plans for these devices through her personal website and in began selling preassembled kits to a steady influx of customers laying the foundation for adafruit which fried officially opened a year later in new york in its square foot industrial space in lower manhattan since adafruit s employees now more than ship hundreds of products per day last year the company sold about million worth of its famed do it yourself kits and other products looking back fried says the competitive entrepreneurial ecosystem at mit helped inspire her to launch her business the entrepreneurial culture is strong at mit she says and when i saw how many of my friends were starting companies out of college it made me think hey if they can do it i can do it too let s do this thing i think that s part of the healthy competition that mit is known for fried also notes that starting and running a company is just hard work either you make something people want or you go out of business there is nothing more helpful to starting a company than a gritty determination she says adding every student should have a blog where they publish their projects some really cool designs come out of classwork or iap but they are rarely shared outside of a class or living group there should be a

stayed up all night programming on the family s apple iie computer when susie applied to mit and received her acceptance letter her father who is a medical doctor who really wanted to be an engineer brought the letter to her in the middle of her high school class she recalls he was so happy it was like he got into mit her older brother also went to mit and is a medical doctor as well as a course vi student susie especially loved the double s etc in particular she loved for which prof hal abelson was her recitation instructor she says i loved the way he taught working with fourier transforms and signals and systems gave me a great way to think about things and got me interested in optics and image processing as she seized opportunities throughout her undergraduate years and into her masters at mit susie wee built on her love for signal processing taking advantage of an institute wide internship program she worked summers at the jet propulsion laboratory ultimately completing her

image and video processing a formative graduate school experience continuing in optics and image processing at mit eecs susie wee joined the lab of the late prof bill schreiber as his last phd student and later she found out she was his first female phd graduate she notes that it was a great experience working with prof schreiber who always just treated me like all the others she particularly appreciated the fact that prof schreiber had returned to his lab from retirement to continue work that aimed at practical application she notes i loved that he was not only advancing theory but he was also making leading edge practical systems over his career he made black and white television into color television black and white printing into color printing and standard definition television into

difference when she interviewed at hewlett packard labs in silicon valley in susie wee gave a talk she figured that it was standard that not only was this advertised but also the room was packed it was affirming that her presentation which was based on her thesis work was considered unique and cutting edge by the hp researchers she says when i got there and started working i found that not all interview talks are so well attended i also found that technically i was really prepared several other factors were striking to her as one of very few females in the hp labs she says i didn t look like anybody else most were older men with button down shirts and khakis nevertheless she and her work were valued and she brought a new dimension to what they wanted to achieve she reasoned the way i am and i think most mit people are i could develop technology all day long at that stage i had no trouble producing things being relevant and pushing the state of the art forward two years into her

education for anyone anywhere students of all ages have been viewing the over videos and using the site associated online adaptive exercise platform and online tracking that encourages learning mastery the story of his journey and his thesis to reinvent education now appears in his book the one world schoolhouse which came out in late sal khan followed his undergraduate education in math and electrical engineering and computer science and his meng in computer science at mit in with several jobs in silicon valley for a few years his first career completing his harvard business school mba in sal khan started his second career as a hedge fund manager in boston then came his third and current career sal khan has the good fortune to be a natural teacher as well as a good computer scientist so he was more than adept at helping his then th grade cousin nadia based in louisiana with a math problem in while he worked in boston teaching at a distance was easily overcome online and eventually nadia and her friends and relatives ballooned into a pre khan academy set of viewers of her cousin sal s short entertaining videos ultimately posted on you tube within a few years khan s interests went well beyond hedge fund management fortunately the increasing recognition and support came just in time as sal reached the tipping point to go on his own donors began to surface including ann doerr and her husband john a silicon valley venture capitalist and then in quick succession bill gates and his family who raved about khan academy to a large audience at the aspen ideas festival in front of people support from google s eric schmidt and more by sal khan was fully launched to run his dream the khan academy sal khan got to this point for lots of reasons including his early schooling and his childhood although sal s mother a single parent from india was forced to work extremely hard at many jobs sal and his older sister and younger brother grew up in an environment that fostered individuality and curiosity in his words for the most part we had a fairly verbal family which in no small way was a euphemism for argumentative but you can t discount that it actually makes you good at articulating yourself on the fly sal is naturally the kind of person who is not afraid to ask questions to understand something to get to the heart of a problem or need to want to teach with passion and effect and to take on natural leadership roles he was president of the class of at mit and president of the student body while a student at harvard business school in so many ways sal khan is what he teaches i teach the way i wish i was taught the lectures are actually coming from me an actual human being who is fascinated by the world around him since his experiences growing up in the public schools in new orleans sal khan has been sensitive to how he was taught when he was selected to join a class for gifted learners he says one of his teachers asked him what do you want to do his reaction i was like what you re asking me what do i want to do you know she kind of gave me license to be creative at the heart of his well formulated thesis about education for humanity sal points to the need for allowing each individual at any age to proactively seek out learning a positive and creative act in itself he proposes that by using the khan academy online videos and exercises which are self paced and uniquely tracked anyone including students in public schools can reach mastery of the material without being turned off by lengthy lectures teachers can finally give their full passion to individual tutoring while all students can help each other as they progress at different and similar rates his ideas on a self paced mastery based model are already being adapted for use in schools in california and elsewhere read more about applying khan academy courses and concepts on the khan academy website https www khanacademy org coach resources sal khan has been thinking about education for a long time when he came to mit he was keenly aware of how smart students were sometimes struggling while others were not he wondered about this at the same time he noticed that the pace forced him and others to be mercenaries with their time i was thinking coldly how to get the most bang for my hour of time he recalls he discovered that he learned best at his own pace whether getting chunks of understanding from a book chapter or working with classmates on a project in the lab he also realized that the people who understood a subject such as math the basis for much of science and engineering holistically on an intuitive level were the ones who learned most deeply it is interesting that between his junior and senior years as an undergraduate at mit sal khan was given the eloranta fellowship to create education software and he created planet

connector remember this student groups dropbox founders drew houston and arash ferdowsi share growing up with code and dreaming of startups when drew houston was very young his parents bought a pcjr their first computer soon after his father a harvard university trained electrical engineer introduced his fascinated five year old son to programming in basic although he played his share of computer games while growing up drew was far more intrigued by how the games worked in fact he taught himself c by reading the source code to a text based online game by freshman year in high school drew gained access to a computer game by signing up to test it not so interested in playing the game he instead discovered a variety of security related bugs and made the game company aware soon after drew at age was invited to work with them though his father had to sign the legal documents the idea of innovation was at drew s core from an early age at a college prep talk to his eighth grade class the speaker asked do you know what you want to do when you grow up drew was the only one to raise his hand he notes i knew that i loved computers and that i wanted to start a company he was also a big fan of bill gates like his dropbox co founder arash ferdowsi began programming at an early age his father introduced arash to q basic while he was in elementary school in kansas city while he was in middle school he took classes at a community college to learn c he too was passionate about computers and programming and realized that mit was the best place in the world to become a computer scientist he says about this decision there was no doubt in my mind that i needed to end up there the ultimate incubator for startup training unlike high school at mit drew found he could devote himself to subjects that he was interested in first and foremost he notes about his mit course vi education i became a better engineer at mit growing up programming was important but paired with the theory i became better much more quickly he also came to understand that good business decisions in technology companies are often made by good engineers you have all these examples of technologists who have picked up the business side on the job but i can t think of any examples in the other direction he notes one of arash s favorite classes at mit was introduction to algorithms in his words i love algorithms i am obsessive about performance and doing everything possible to shave milliseconds off code runtime helped formalize a lot of my intuition around performance and gave me a much deeper understanding of how to design algorithms that truly scale this was particularly important because my main focus in the early days of dropbox was to figure out how to make our backend infrastructure horizontally scalable drew wasn t expecting it but his experiences living in his fraternity at mit became his first training for managing dropbox not only did he learn to live with and appreciate many people who were naturally gifted in diverse areas but he also took on offices such as rush chair recollecting this responsibility he says you re handed a budget and some unpaid volunteers and you ve got to make something very complicated happen which is very similar to my experience with dropbox although arash had felt for a long time that one had to have a business degree or a lot of experience to start a company he became aware through friends in classes and at his east campus dorm that this was not necessarily true besides his dropbox experience he credits the infectious curiosity for hacking and innovating that he found all around him at mit with several friends who ultimately joined dropbox arash started a book exchange website called bookx mit at mit drew surrounded himself with people who were also interested in starting companies he joined the entrepreneurs club took courses like prof hadzima s nuts and bolts business plans during iap and met a lot of other mit entrepreneurs he also remembers and values talking with eecs faculty such as prof charles leiserson about their experiences starting companies drew has always been interested in both business and management so it wasn t surprising that he would take a class or two at sloan he describes one in particular one of the most eye opening classes i took was the negotiation class at sloan here was a subject that at first seemed totally opaque to me were we going to practice bluffing and yelling instead he discovered well established and logical frameworks that could allow anyone to become an effective negotiator he notes the important lesson for me was that some things that i didn t understand at all leadership public speaking management could be learned and weren t as mystical as i thought arash s passion has always been in scale making things work across thousands of computers and distributed systems that make every aspect of a design horizontally scalable after his sophomore year at mit he applied to intern at facebook he notes the fact that it was growing so rapidly meant that they were doing pretty innovative things to reach scale that definitely appealed to me the right amount of frustration good luck and timing not long after graduating from mit and on his way to new york city drew experienced a reality check that has now been

and passion will followshare preoccupations follow a career passion let it follow you by cal newport published september in the spring of during my senior year of college i faced a hard decision about my future career i had a job offer from microsoft and an acceptance letter from the computer science doctoral program at the massachusetts institute of technology i had also just handed in the manuscript for my first nonfiction book which opened the option of becoming a full time writer these are three strikingly different career paths and i had to choose which one was right for me enlarge this image daniel rosenbaum for the new york times cal newport a computer science professor at georgetown says many people lack a true calling but have a sense of fulfillment that grows over time for many of my peers this decision would have been fraught with anxiety growing up we were told by guidance counselors career advice books the news media and others to follow our passion this advice assumes that we all have a pre existing passion waiting to be discovered if we have the courage to discover this calling and to match it to our livelihood the thinking goes we ll end up happy if we lack this courage we ll end up bored and unfulfilled or worse in law school to a small group of people this advice makes sense because they have a clear passion maybe they ve always wanted to be doctors writers musicians and so on and can t imagine being anything else but this philosophy puts a lot of pressure on the rest of us and demands long deliberation if we re not careful it tells us we may end up missing our true calling and even after we make a choice we re still not free from its effects every time our work becomes hard we are pushed toward an existential crisis centered on what for many is an obnoxiously unanswerable question is this what i m really meant to be doing this constant doubt generates anxiety and chronic job hopping as i considered my options during my senior year of college i knew all about this cult of passion and its demands but i chose to ignore it the alternative career philosophy that drove me is based on this simple premise the traits that lead people to love their work are general and have little to do with a job s specifics these traits include a sense of autonomy and the feeling that you re good at what you do and are having an impact on the world decades of research on workplace motivation back this up daniel pink s book drive offers a nice summary of this literature these traits can be found in many jobs but they have to be earned building valuable skills is hard and takes time for someone in a new position the right question is not what is this job offering me but instead what am i offering this job returning to my story i decided after only minimal deliberation to go to m i t true to my alternative career philosophy i was confident that all three of my career options could be transformed into a source of passion and this confidence freed me from worry about making a wrong choice i ended up choosing m i t mainly because of a slight preference for the east coast but i would have been equally content heading out to microsoft s headquarters near seattle or with the advance from my first book i could have hunkered down in a quiet town to write during my initial years as a graduate student i certainly didn t enjoy an unshakable sense that i had found my true calling the beginning of doctoral training can be rough you re not yet skilled enough to make contributions to the research literature which can be frustrating and at a place like m i t you re surrounded by brilliance which can make you question whether you belong had i subscribed to the follow our passion orthodoxy i probably would have left during those first years worried that i didn t feel love for my work every day but i knew that my sense of fulfillment would grow over time as i became better at my job so i worked hard and as my competence grew so did my engagement today i m a computer science professor at georgetown university and i love my job the most important lesson i can draw from my experience is that this love has nothing to do with figuring out at an early age that i was meant to be a professor there s nothing special about my choosing this particular path what mattered is what i did once i made my choice to other young people who constantly wonder if the grass might be greener on the other side of the occupational fence i offer this advice passion is not something you follow it s something that will follow you as you put in the hard work to become valuable to the world cal newport is the author of so good they can t ignore you a version of this article appeared in print on september on page bu of the new york edition with the headline follow a passion let it follow you mit electrical engineering computer science room massachusetts avenue cambridge ma

share yehia massoud is the wallace bunn endowed chair of the electrical and computer engineering department and the director of the center for integrated systems at the university of alabama at birmingham uab before joining mit i had always managed to excel at every level with minimal last minute effort it was at mit where my limits were really challenged i learned that intelligence can only take a person so far but if combined with strong commitment and consistent work it can lead to profound success it was my phd thesis advisor professor jacob white who taught me the importance of perseverance and staying the course regardless of the difficulties and the obstacles along the way in the midst of my phd i went through a tough six month period during which i was basically working day and night with negligible progress trying to solve a persistent problem in my numerical integral formulation that limited the formulation s generality and applicability during this period jacob regularly encouraged me to keep working at the problem and looking at it from different angles and perspectives jacob s relentless commitment and patience enabled me to overcome the biggest obstacle in my phd dissertation and led to the generation of an accurate and efficient generalized formulation that was highly regarded by the research community at mit i was very fortunate to have had research interactions discussions and classes from great eecs professors such as stephen senturia steven leeb dimitri antoniadis anantha chandrakasan srinivas devadas munther dahleh and jes s del alamo these professors put great emphasis on developing deep understanding of basics along with unwavering dedication to rigorous knowledge of advanced topics this helped ignite an unending desire for attaining intuitive understanding as well as maintaining analytical rigor in my research mit eecs professors also have very high expectations of their students i particularly remember my phd qualification exam where i was asked to solve some problems on the board one of these problems was given by prof markus zahn at the end of the allotted ten minutes i noticed that markus was visibly pleased this came as a surprise to me since i did not reach a final solution markus then explained that the problem was an open problem and that he wanted to see how i would proceed in solving such a problem he then told me he was pleased to see me reach the state of the art in solving this problem in those ten minutes what struck me at that moment was how high the expectations were for eecs graduate students to give an open problem in a qualifier exam i decided then that i ought to have the same high expectation of myself and to never settle for less one of my most defining career moments was when i started my academic career as an assistant professor at rice university in i needed to devise a plan for what i would do and how i would do it i looked around and found that many junior professors in academia follow what they perceive as the safe tenure path where they continue to grind their phd topic until tenure i viewed this common safe path as a trap that discourages breadth and broad mindedness as well as encouraging risk avoidance and complacency leading to careers that are often highlighted by incremental research and insignificant contributions i challenged myself to make my own path and to pursue quality research in the areas that i felt were important and valuable regardless of my comfort level in these areas i wanted to make a difference and have an impact within two to three years of making this commitment my group grew rapidly and we were able to make several well received contributions in multiple areas while developing a wide breadth and a clear research vision naturally rice liked my progress so much that they promoted me to associate professor during my fourth year three years faster than the standard rice cycle four years later while i was in the process of getting promoted to full professor i was recruited by uab to help rebuild its electrical and computer engineering program into one of the top interdisciplinary research programs in the southeast i felt i could make a significant difference as department head so i accepted the challenge thanks to mit eecs for teaching me that if you believe in yourself and have the

panel discussions that focused on a broad range of topics including product development founders stories mit s entrepreneurial resources networking common startup mistakes and creating company culture the lineup of speakers was equally diverse ranging from startup novices to serial entrepreneurs and spanning multiple industries additional activities such as mock customer interviews and creating a pitch focused on honing basic entrepreneurial skills the aim is to give our students and postdocs a rich view of what it means to be an entrepreneur says startmit head organizer and eecs department head anantha chandrakasan in three weeks participants walk away with an understanding of what entrepreneurship is all about the different views and learning how to put a pitch together among other things during the final two days student groups were required to deliver brief pitches for commercial ideas they formed during the course these included hacking recruitment services smart windows new

many ways in which we can do good and one of those ways is to start companies he said adding by learning from experts and by learning from one another you re on your way to fulfilling not just the mit mission but fulfilling your own mission in starting companies seasoned entrepreneurs eight days of talks and panel discussions saw seasoned mit affiliated entrepreneurs and innovators offering sage advice to students about starting companies in her jan talk mit professor sangeeta bhatia who has launched several biotech companies gave a behind the scenes look at the sometimes arduous process of taking innovations from lab to market to highlight everything you don t see in the press she said in bhatia the john j and dorothy wilson professor in the institute for medical engineering and science and the department of electrical engineering and computer science spun out years of mit research into hepregen now a successful company hepregen s micro liver platform allows liver cells to function outside the body for up to six weeks for use by researchers and pharmaceutical firms among other topics bhatia discussed struggles of developing the technology for commercial use manufacturing hassles and anxieties of dealing with big name pharmaceutical customers what did we learn we learned it takes a long time to start a biotech company bhatia said however as engineers and scientists translation of your technology to make an impact through commercialization is actually imperative in a kickoff talk on jan eecs lecturer christina chase a former entrepreneur in residence at the martin trust center for mit entrepreneurship and founder of several tech companies detailed key reasons tech startups fail among these she said are scaling a company too soon by hiring too many employees splurging

computer science draper a former nickelodeon star brought her trademark approachable style to the event encouraging panelists to jump in to the discussion with a question on how mit has touched their careers the key critical characteristic i think i found in myself and in other entrepreneurs is the ability to problem solve and that s the thing i learned here the most in my curriculum kadakia shared she emphasized that this skill has seen her through the development of many phases of classpass a fitness membership startup that she launched in it taught me to always take something and figure out the solution i never got stuck the advice hit home for the audience made up of alumni and students enrolled in startmit a program developed by the department of electrical engineering and computer science and supported by the innovation initiative and chaired by eecs department head anantha chandrakasan over the last two weeks the undergraduates graduate students and postdocs in the program have heard from founders and innovators in startups industry and academia about challenges they faced in their own careers for greiner it was the power of the mit network that proved to be most valuable i met my business partners at mit and many other people in my network you want to use this opportunity while you re at mit to meet the professors meet other people that are in your field because you never know where people will end up shifting the focus to mit s history and its involvement in creating the current ecosystem of entrepreneurship in greater boston hockfield shared that during her tenure as president she saw a new wave of innovation rising in the region she knew mit could foster it leading the institute to participate in accelerating the development of kendall square by being a really good partner to the city and to the companies my role was to pour a little gasoline on the flames addressing the topic of raising funding draper asked the panel whether it was the idea the product or the user base that was more important to katabi who has seen a couple of startups out of her lab at mit it was your promise to the investor that mattered the most people don t see much at the beginning your promise is in the future so it s you it s the idea and it s the market it s also that the promise once delivered it will make a difference an audience member asked the panel to share what catalyzed their decision to leap into entrepreneurship greiner replied that she made the move early on in her career co founding irobot shortly after graduating from mit she continued that it took the company years to move into market calling it the longest overnight success story you ve ever seen she further explained that her experience developing irobot had its low points as well when funded projects couldn t move forward and that it s really not always about the idea it s about the timing of the idea which is just as critical when asked about the challenges of being a woman in technology greiner answered you have to look at everything for what it is it can be a double edge sword back in there were even fewer women in technology that was bad but on the other hand when i would go meetings people would remember me as the robot lady everything s a double edge sword and if you look at the positive you keep going forward because we need women in tech joi ito director of the mit media lab offered the panel closing remarks on the innovative research happening at the media lab ito who spent much of his career as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist commented on the complementary roles that academia and startups play in developing new technology the difference between the mindset at startups and in the academic world was particularly interesting to ito who joined mit in whereas startups must focus on short term goals and the marketability of their products academics can spend time thinking about long term goals and the math and science underpinning new technology he remarked and both ways of thinking play a role in deploying new technologies i ve spent the last five years trying to understand how technology makes it out into the real world ito said having done that i see the importance of translation of technology into the real world and the role that startups have in that mit electrical engineering computer science room

custom camouflage use algorithms with disguise functionality share may unlike addressing the problem of object detection a major area of research in computer vision prof bill freeman principal investigator in the computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail and associate department head in mit s electrical engineering and computer science eecs department has worked with eecs graduate student andrew owens and colleagues from the university of virginia the woods hole oceanographic institute and flyby media to devise a way for algorithms to aid in disguising objects that are in public view but not enhancing to the overall environment photo above four views of box on a bookshelf with a printed camouflage pattern wrapped around it note how from some perspectives the spine of a book on the shelf appears to fork courtesy of the researchers read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled custom camouflage new algorithms produce patterns that could hide eyesores in public places also posted below if a bulky electrical box has to be placed at the edge of a public park what s the best way to conceal it so that it won t detract from its surroundings how about an air conditioning condenser beside a historical building or a portable toilet along a scenic trail at the conference on computer vision and pattern recognition in june researchers from mit and several other institutions take a first stab at answering these types of questions with a new algorithm that can analyze photos of a scene taken from multiple perspectives and produce a camouflage covering for an object placed within it the researchers developed a range of candidate algorithms and tested them using amazon s mechanical turk crowdsourcing application scoring them according to the amount of time volunteers took to locate camouflaged objects in synthetic images objects hidden by their best performing algorithm took on average more than three seconds to find significantly longer than the casual glance the camouflage is intended to thwart according to andrew owens an mit graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and lead author on the new paper the problem of disguising objects in a scene is to some degree the inverse of the problem of object detection a major area of research in computer vision often these algorithms work by searching for specific cues for example they might look for the contours of the object or for distinctive textures owens says with camouflage you want to avoid these cues you don t want the object s contours to be visible or for its texture to be very distinctive conceptually a cue that would be good for detecting an object is something that you want to remove greed works in their new paper owens and his collaborators william freeman an mit professor of computer science and engineering and one of his thesis advisors connelly barnes of the university of virginia flyby media s alex flint and hanumant singh of the woods hole oceanographic institution assume that the object to be concealed is box shaped since that s generally true of the real world scenarios in which they envision their technology being applied all of the candidate algorithms begin at the same place for each camera angle they generate a set of coverings for the object s visible faces that would make it blend into the background perfectly of course a pattern that works well from one camera angle could make the object stick out like a sore thumb from another so the algorithms then begin making trade offs this video shows several views of virtual d boxes that have been camouflaged using the researchers algorithms video courtesy of the researchers the simplest algorithm averages the color values of the patterns produced for each face from each camera angle the next algorithm simply picks one angle at random for each face these provided a baseline for the tests on mechanical turk a slightly more sophisticated algorithm which the researchers dubbed greedy identifies those camera angles that require the least distortion of the patterns applied to each face to create the illusion of a circle seen head on for instance a face at an oblique angle to the camera would have to have an ellipse superimposed on it the sharper the angle the more elongated the ellipse would need to be the greedy algorithm tries to minimize the difference between the shape perceived by the viewer and the shape patterned on the object once it s identified a group of angles that meet that criterion it selects the one that generates coverings for the largest number of faces less is more the researchers first attempt at a more sophisticated algorithm divided each face of the object into a grid each square of which takes color values corresponding to a single camera angle the algorithm then selected a value for each square that offered the best approximation of views from as many angles as possible but it also ensured that the transitions between regions corresponding to different angles were smooth this can lead to some odd visual artifacts as an experiment the researchers used their algorithm to produce a camouflage covering for a box placed on a bookshelf in their lab when the viewer faces the box from a particular angle a book on the shelf appears to fork a projection of the book s spine on the top face of the box approaches a corner and in order not to introduce jarring discontinuities sends tendrils down both adjacent faces but as peculiar as that bifurcation looks upon close inspection the smoothness of the boundaries means that it doesn t call attention to itself in some preliminary tests on mechanical turk however the greedy algorithm fared surprisingly well the researchers inferred that that s because the topology of the environments they were considering naturally

projectshare the uap requirement all course vi undergraduates must complete the senior project requirement an extra ci m department lab and superurop will also satisfy this requirement but perhaps the simplest way to do it is uap a six unit one term capstone supervised independent project which is usually done in the senior year for which the meng thesis proposal can be used the only prerequisite is uat the six unit professional technical communications class students are encouraged to take uat earlier than senior year because it precedes uap and uap may also be completed in the junior or senior year after uat both of these subjects are graded on a letter grade not a pass fail basis the uap provides an exciting opportunity for students to build on and reinforce their classroom and laboratory learning it gives students the chance to work both more independently and more directly with a research supervisor on a project demanding intellectual rigor design and quantitative skills as well as interpersonal and communication skills using a third lab for the uap requirement course vi students who have satisfied the institute lab typically with an eecs intro class plus the department lab and third year ci m requirements with the same subject if it s ci m may use another department ci m lab subject to satisfy the uap requirement no substitution or petition process is required meng students and uap students who have been admitted to the meng program must still register for and complete the senior project requirement to receive the s b degree and are strongly encouraged to submit for uap their formal meng thesis proposal instead of a final project report this is meant to encourage meng students to find and begin the meng thesis early in their senior year as all the preliminary and background work for the thesis must be completed in order to submit a graded thesis proposal by starting the meng thesis in the senior year students have time to do a more substantial thesis and enhance their likelihood of being funded as research assistants and and of graduating by the end of the fifth year meng students who plan to take more than five years to receive

well in advance of this deadline there is no specific format required for the final report and no formal title page please use the best standards of technical writing as described in technical writing

academic information who s teaching what program objectives masterworks working on the thesis and avoiding delayshare many students fail to graduate on time because their theses are not complete some delays are inevitable but there are ways to minimize them unavailable parts special parts which have to be ordered can cause delays of weeks or months try to find alternate sources other ways of coping and do legwork rather than passively waiting for parts to arrive do other aspects of the thesis like writing if waiting is unavoidable waiting for other people to do their part ph d students and faculty can operate on a different time scale than m eng students next term can be almost as good as next week try to anticipate and work around these problems avoiding projects that are excessively interwoven with theses that can t really be started until somebody else makes something work think flexibly about altering your project to avoid this but not by enlarging it to include other people s projects bear in mind that some faculty are more accustomed to extensive two year research masters theses not the term m eng thesis projects the incredible expanding thesis your project will evolve as you progress but that should not mean that it gets bigger and more inclusive negotiate diplomatically the alienated supervisor students often think a supervisor has lost patience with the student and the project when it is nothing personal just the press of other commitments do notreact to this situation by disappearing keep working and keep your supervisor aware of your efforts and progress they like to know what is going on and they hate feeling that you ve disappeared be visible and send updates even if there s no response writing delays students can be frustrated when they hand their supervisors a chapter or two of write up which it took them a few hours to write and find that it takes the supervisor several days or even weeks to read correct and return it other students find it impossible to start writing don t wait until you are finished designing programming testing debugging etc to start writing go to the barker engineering library and read theses similar to yours for good ideas about presentation tone etc develop a detailed outline with lots of notes a list of figures a reasonable format there s no single correct format bibliography draft an introduction and first chapter listen carefully to your supervisor s suggestions for revision don t wait until it is written to show it to your supervisor take at least the first chapter to the writing center for analysis and assistance lack of discipline and time management skills working on a thesis may be different from anything you ve done while at mit for four years you may have had nothing but short specific and discrete tasks due at short term intervals with the thesis there is a final deadline a term or more away this requires a different kind of self discipline make a schedule write out a detailed ordered list of tasks that have to be done allowing for the inevitable delays and other commitments and aiming not for the final deadline but for a week or so earlier set specific short term deadlines and be a hard taskmaster if you find your hours days and weeks melting away to no effect take early action the uaap has material and programs available to help you with time management note that supervisors will expect a first draft of the thesis document well in advance of the deadline use the barker engineering library barker is eager to help thesis students at every stage of the thesis project the library can help students to approach topics to perform on line searches and to assist with indexes abstracts and citations funding and special equipment if you need special computer accounts or equipment for your thesis ask your thesis supervisor if your work is for a sponsored research project or an academic subject there are funds which should pay for necessary equipment the use of department laboratory kits is discouraged the department has little or no funding available for general thesis support but see cents link if you just can t finish if you re going to miss the deadline not by hours or days but by weeks or months sit down with your supervisor and agree on what exactly has to be done get off the degree list arrange for housing for extra time and keep going it is very difficult to complete a thesis long distance or while working students who are sure they have only a few weeks of work left end up graduating several terms later a few

academic information who s teaching what program objectives masterworks submitting the thesisshare deadlines and extensions this academic year s deadlines are listed on the front page of this document note that the department s final thesis deadlines are much later than the institute s deadlines going past the institute s deadline to the department s deadline is not considered an extension and does not require any permission the institute deadline means nothing to course vi students do not call us or email to check the deadline trust us here s why the department deadline is later than the institute one because the institute allows ten days after its deadline for supervisors to read and grade theses we know from experience that by the time they are ready to sign theses supervisors know the grade students must bring to us the completed grade sheet with the final copy of the thesis the department s thesis deadline means that students who hand in theses after that date are not guaranteed that their final thesis grade will be posted in time for them to graduate that term students who hand in a thesis late may be able to graduate at commencement but not have their names in the commencement book students who fail to graduate because their thesis wasn t submitted in time will have to register for the following term get on that term s degree list and graduate at the end of it no extensions of that guarantee beyond the final department deadline as listed on the front of this guide are possible no thesis supervisor is empowered to extend the deadline since there are no extensions there are no forms to be filled out to get an extension students should not give up at the deadline but should hand in their theses as fast as possible you may hand in your thesis on any

fink teams to create valuable fibers out of everyday materials share february yoel fink director of mit s research laboratory of electronics and professor of materials science and electrical engineering and computer sicence has teamed to develop multifunctional fibers made from abundant low cost aluminum metal and silica glass the process initially thought a mistake is now clearly producing fibers with a pure silicon core potentially forming the basis for making high quality fiber based electronic devices graduate student chong hou holds a bag of drawn fibers the fibers are as thin as micrometers in diameter and the material coating further enhances the strength of the fibers photo jose luis olivares mit news office read more in the february mit news office article by david l chandler titled fibers made by transforming materials new approach could enable low cost silicon devices in fibers that could be made into fabrics also posted below scientists have known how to draw thin fibers from bulk materials for decades but a new approach to that old method developed by researchers at mit could lead to a whole new way of making high quality fiber based electronic devices the idea grew out of a long term research effort to develop multifunctional fibers that incorporate different materials into a single long functional strand until now those long strands could only be created by arranging the materials in a large block or cylinder called a preform which is then heated and stretched to create a thin fiber that is drastically smaller in diameter but retains the same composition now for the first time fibers created through this method can have a composition that s completely different from that of the starting materials an advance that senior author yoel fink refers to as a kind of alchemy turning inexpensive and abundant materials into high value ones the new findings are described in a paper in the journal nature communications co authored by graduate student chong hou and six others at mit and in singapore the fibers are made from aluminum metal and silica glass abundant low cost materials which are commonly used to make windows and window frames the aluminum metal and silica glass react chemically as they are heated and drawn producing a fiber with a core of pure crystalline silicon the raw material of computer chips and solar cells and a coating of silica the initial discovery was a complete surprise in experiments designed to test the possibility of incorporating metal wires inside fibers hou tried a variety of metals including silver copper and aluminum and in the latter case the result was not what they expected when i looked at the fiber instead of a shiny metallic core i observed a dark substance i really didn t know what happened says hou who is the lead author of the paper upon analysis the researchers found that the core had turned to silicon in fact very pure crystalline silicon my initial reaction might have been to discard the sample altogether fink says after seeing that the experiment failed to produce the expected result but instead hou began to examine the specimen and apply rigorous analysis soon realizing that the mundane result he expected was replaced by a surprising one which is how this discovery came about it turned out that the chemical reaction in the fiber was a well known one at the high temperatures used for drawing the fiber about degrees celsius the pure aluminum core reacted with the silica a form of silicon oxide the reaction left behind pure silicon concentrated in the core of the fiber and aluminum oxide which deposited a very thin layer of aluminum between the core and the silica cladding now hou says we can use this to get electrical devices like solar cells or transistors or any silicon based semiconductor devices that could be built inside the fiber many teams have tried to create such devices within fibers he says but so far all of the methods tried have required starting with expensive high purity silicon now we can use an inexpensive metal hou says it gives us a new approach to generating a silicon core fiber fink who is a professor of materials science and electrical engineering and head of mit s research laboratory of electronics says this represents the first time that a fiber is drawn which is radically different from its preform it opens

the team is working to produce specific structures such as an electrical junction inside the material as it is drawn we could put other metals in there like gold or copper and make a real electrical circuit he says fink adds that this is a new way of thinking about fibers and it could be a way of getting fibers to do a lot more than they ever have as mobile devices continue to grow into an ever larger segment of the electronics business for example this technology could open up new possibilities for electronics including solar cells and microchips to be incorporated into fibers and woven

says john ballato director of the center for optical materials science and engineering technologies at clemson university in south carolina who was not involved in this research he says of particular

lab csail has teamed with postdoctoral associate daniel feldman to describe a novel way to represent data so that it takes up much less space in memory but can still be processed in conventional ways when needed they will present this work titled the single pixel gps learning big data signals from tiny coresets at the association for computing machinery s international conference on advances in geographic information systems to be held this month read more in the nov mit news office article by larry hardesty titled speeding algorithms by shrinking data a new approach to processing big data creates succinct representations of huge data sets so that existing algorithms can handle them efficiently also posted below in its entirety in computer science the buzzword of the day is big data the proliferation of cheap internet connected sensors such as the gps receivers accelerometers and cameras in smartphones has meant an explosion of information whose potential uses have barely begun to be explored in large part that s because processing all that data can be prohibitively time consuming most computer scientists try to make better sense of big data by developing ever more efficient algorithms but in a paper presented this month at the association for computing machinery s international conference on advances in geographic information systems mit researchers take the opposite approach describing a novel way to represent data so that it takes up much less space in memory but can still be processed in conventional ways while promising significant computational speedups the approach could be more generally applicable than other big data techniques since it can work with existing algorithms in the new paper the researchers apply their technique to two dimensional location data generated by gps receivers a very natural application that also demonstrates clearly how the technique works as daniela rus a professor of computer science and engineering and director of mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory explains gps receivers take position readings every seconds which adds up to a gigabyte of data each day a computer system trying to process gps data from tens of thousands of cars in order to infer traffic patterns could quickly be overwhelmed but in analyzing the route traversed by a car it s generally not necessary to consider the precise coordinates of every point along the route the essential information is the points at which the car turns the path between such points can be approximated by a straight line that s what the new algorithm does a key aspect of the algorithm explains dan feldman a postdoc in rus group and lead author on the new paper is that it can compress data on the fly for instance it could compress the first megabyte of data it receives from a car then wait until another megabyte builds up and compress again then wait for another megabyte and so on and yet the final representation of the data would preserve almost as much information as if the algorithm had waited for all the data to arrive before compressing drawing the line in some sense feldman says the problem of approximating pathways between points is similar to the problem solved by regression analysis a procedure common in statistics that finds the one line that best fits a scatter of data points one major difference however is that the researchers algorithm has to find a series of line segments that best fit the data points as feldman explains choosing the number of line segments involves a trade off between accuracy and complexity if you have n points k the number of line segments is a number between and n and when you increase k the error will be smaller feldman says if you just connect every two points the error will be zero but then it won t be a good approximation if you just take k equal to like linear regression it will be too rough an approximation so the first task of the algorithm is to find the optimal trade off between number of line segments and error the next step is to calculate the optimal set of k line segments the ones that best fit the data the step after that however is the crucial one in addition to storing a mathematical representation of the line segment that best fits each scatter of points the algorithm also stores the precise coordinates of a random sampling of the points points that fall farther from the line have a higher chance of being sampled but the sampled points are also given a weight that s inversely proportional to their chance of being sampled that is points close to the line have a lower chance of being sampled but if one of them is sampled it s given more weight since it stands in for a larger number of unsampled points it s this combination of linear approximations and random samples that enables the algorithm to compress data on the fly on the basis of the samples the algorithm can recalculate the optimal line segments if needed as new data arrives satisfaction guaranteed during compression some information is lost but feldman rus and graduate student cynthia sung the paper s third author were able to provide strict mathematical guarantees that the error introduced will stay beneath a low threshold in many big data contexts a slightly erroneous approximation is much better than a calculation that can t be performed at all in principle the same approach could work with any type of data in many more dimensions than the two recorded by gps receivers for instance with each gps reading a car could also

berger and students create algorithm to keep up with genomic data generationshare july professor of applied math and computer science at mit and head of the computation and biology group bonnie berger has developed an algorithm that allows researchers to access huge amounts of data in geneome databases despite the rate of genome sequencing that has nearly outpaced researchers ability to analyze the added data searching genomic data faster biologists capacity for generating genomic data is increasing more rapidly than computing power a new algorithm will help them keep up posted below in its entirety graphic left courtesy christine daniloff mit news in the human genome project and celera genomics announced that after years of work at a cost of some million they had completed a draft sequence of the human genome today sequencing a human genome is something that a single researcher can do in a couple of weeks for less than since the rate at which genomes can be sequenced has been doubling every four months or so whereas computing power doubles only every months without the advent of new analytic tools biologists ability to generate genomic data will soon outstrip their ability to do anything useful with it in the latest issue of nature biotechnology mit and harvard university researchers describe a new algorithm in their paper compressive genomics that drastically reduces the time it takes to find a particular gene sequence in a database of genomes moreover the more genomes it s searching the greater the speedup it affords so its advantages will only compound as more data is generated in some sense this is a data compression algorithm like the one that allows computer users to compress data files into smaller zip files you have all this data and clearly if you want to store it what people would naturally do is compress it says bonnie berger a professor of applied math and computer science at mit and senior author on the paper the problem is that eventually you have to look at it so you have to decompress it to look at it but our insight is that if you compress the data in the right way then you can do your analysis directly on the compressed data and that increases the speed while maintaining the accuracy of the analyses exploiting redundancy the researchers compression scheme exploits the fact that evolution is stingy with good designs there s a great deal of overlap in the genomes of closely related species and some overlap even in the genomes of distantly related species that s why experiments performed on yeast cells can tell us something about human drug reactions berger her former grad student michael baym phd who s now a visiting scholar in the mit math department and a postdoc in systems biology at harvard medical school and her current grad student po ru loh developed a way to mathematically represent the genomes of different species or of different individuals within a species such that the overlapping data is stored only once a search of multiple genomes can thus concentrate on their differences saving time if i want to run a computation on my genome it takes a certain amount of time baym explains if i then want to run the same computation on your genome the fact that we re so similar means that i ve already done most of the work in experiments on a database of yeast genomes the researchers compared their algorithm to one called blast for basic local alignment search tool one of the most commonly used genomic search algorithms in biology in a search for a particular genetic sequence in only of the yeast genomes the new algorithm was twice as fast as blast but in a search of all genomes it was four times as fast that discrepancy will only increase as genomic databases grow larger berger explains matchmaking the new algorithm would be useful in any application where the central question is as baym puts it i have a sequence what is it similar to identifying microbes is one example the new algorithm could help clinicians determine causes of infections or it could help biologists characterize microbiomes collections of microbes found in animal tissue or particular microenvironments variations in the human microbiome have been implicated in a range of medical conditions it could be used to characterize the microbes in particularly fertile or infertile soil and it could even be used in forensics to determine the geographical origins of physical evidence by its microbial signatures the problem that they re looking at which is given a sequence trying to determine what known sequences are similar to it is probably the oldest problem in computational biology and it s perhaps the most commonly asked question in computational biology says mona singh a professor of computer science at princeton university and a faculty member at princeton s lewis sigler institute for integrative genomics and the problem just for that reason is of central importance in the last years singh says biologists have tended to think in terms of reference genomes genomes such as the draft human sequence released in that try to generalize across individuals within a species and even across species but as we re getting more and more individuals even within a species and more very closely related sequenced distinct species i think we re starting to move away from the idea of a single reference genome singh says their approach is really going to shine when you have many closely related organisms berger s group is currently working to extend the technique to information on proteins and rna sequences where it could pay even bigger dividends now that the human genome has been mapped the major questions in biology are what genes are active when and how the proteins they code for

csail news balakrishnan winstein develop remy an enhanced congestion control systemshare july researchers from csail and center for wireless networks and mobile computing have developed a tcp congestion control system called remy which they will present at the annual conference of the association for computing machinery s special interest group on data communications hari balakrishnan the fujitsu professor of electrical engineering and computer science and eecs graduate student keith winstein are the authors of the work titled tcp ex machina computer generated congestion control read more in the july mit news office article by larry hardesty titled a faster internet designed by computers also posted below tcp the transmission control protocol is one of the core protocols governing the internet if counted as a computer program it s the most widely used program in the world one of tcp s main functions is to prevent network congestion by regulating the rate at which computers send data in the last years engineers have made steady improvements to tcp s congestion control algorithms resulting in several competing versions of the protocol many windows computers for instance run a version called compound tcp while linux machines run a version called tcp cubic at the annual conference of the association for computing machinery s special interest group on data communication this summer researchers from mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and center for wireless networks and mobile computing will present a computer system dubbed remy that automatically generates tcp congestion control algorithms in the researchers simulations algorithms produced by remy significantly outperformed algorithms devised by human engineers i think people can think about what happens to one or two connections in a network and design around that says hari balakrishnan the fujitsu professor in electrical engineering and computer science who co authored the new paper with graduate student keith winstein when you have even a handful of connections or more and a slightly more complicated network where the workload is not a constant a single file being sent or files being sent that s very hard for human beings to reason about and computers seem to be a lot better about navigating that search space lay of the land remy is a machine learning system meaning that it arrives at its output by trying lots of different possibilities and exploring further variations on those that seem to work best users specify certain characteristics of the network such as whether the bandwidth across links fluctuates or the number of users changes and by how much they also provide a traffic profile that might describe say the percentage of users who are browsing static web pages or using high bandwidth applications like videoconferencing finally the user also specifies the metrics to be used to evaluate network performance standard metrics include throughput which indicates the total amount of data that can be moved through the network in a fixed amount of time and delay which indicates the average amount of time it takes one packet of information to travel from sender to receiver the user can also assign metrics different weights say reducing delay is important but only one third as important as increasing throughput remy needs to test each candidate algorithm s performance under a wide range of network conditions which could have been a prohibitively time consuming task but winstein and balakrishnan developed a clever algorithm that can concentrate remy s analyses on cases in which small variations in network conditions produce large variations in performance while spending much less time on cases where network behavior is more predictable they also designed remy to evaluate possible indicators of network congestion that human engineers have not considered typically tcp congestion control algorithms look at two main factors whether individual data packets arrive at their intended destination and if they do how long it takes for acknowledgments to arrive but as it turns out the ratio between the rates at which packets are sent and received is a rich signal that can dictate a wide range of different behaviors on the sending computer s end down to cases indeed where a typical tcp congestion control algorithm might consist of a handful of rules if the percentage of dropped packets crosses some threshold cut the transmission rate in half the algorithms that remy produces can have more than distinct rules it doesn t resemble anything in the year history of tcp winstein says traditionally tcp has relatively simple endpoint rules but complex behavior when you actually use it with remy the opposite is true we think that s better because computers are good at dealing with complexity it s the behavior you want to be simple why the algorithms remy produces work as well as they do is one of the topics the researchers hope to explore going forward in the meantime however there s little arguing with the results balakrishnan and winstein tested remy s algorithms on a simulation system called the ns which is standard in the field in tests that simulated a high speed wired network with consistent transmission rates across physical links remy s algorithms roughly doubled network throughput when compared to compound tcp and tcp cubic while reducing delay by two thirds in another set of tests which simulated verizon s cellular data network the gains were smaller but still significant a to percent improvement in throughput and a to percent reduction in delay i am thrilled by the approach says victor bahl research manager of the mobility and networking group at microsoft research when you can constrain the problem domain and define precisely what you want out of the protocol i can believe that their system is better than a human bahl cautions that when the protocol has to do many things for many people or many devices then it s not clear whether this is

photographs with just the touch of a button thanks to a processor chip developed at mit the chip built by a team at mit s microsystems technology laboratory can perform tasks such as creating more realistic or enhanced lighting in a shot without destroying the scene s ambience in just a fraction of a second the technology could be integrated with any smartphone tablet computer or digital camera existing computational photography systems tend to be software applications that are installed onto cameras and smartphones however such systems consume substantial power take a considerable amount of time to run and require a fair amount of knowledge on the part of the user says the paper s lead author rahul rithe a graduate student in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science we wanted to build a single chip that could perform multiple operations consume significantly less power compared to doing the same job in software and do it all in real time rithe says he developed the chip with anantha chandrakasan the joseph f and nancy p keithley professor of electrical engineering fellow graduate student priyanka raina research scientist nathan ickes and undergraduate srikanth tenneti one such task known as high dynamic range hdr imaging is designed to compensate for limitations on the range of brightness that can be recorded by existing digital cameras to capture pictures that more accurately reflect the way we perceive the same scenes with our own eyes to do this the chip s processor automatically takes three separate low dynamic range images with the camera a normally exposed image an overexposed image capturing details in the dark areas of the scene and an underexposed image capturing details in the bright areas it then merges them to create one image capturing the entire range of brightness in the scene rithe says software based systems typically take several seconds to perform this operation while the chip can do it in a few hundred milliseconds on a megapixel image this means it is even fast enough to apply to video ickes says the chip consumes dramatically less power than existing cpus and gpus while performing the operation he adds another task the chip can carry out is to enhance the lighting in a darkened scene more realistically than conventional flash photography typically when taking pictures in a low light situation if we don t use flash on the camera we get images that are pretty dark and noisy and if we do use the flash we get bright images but with harsh lighting and the ambience created by the natural lighting in the room is lost rithe says so in this instance the processor takes two images one with a flash and one without it then splits both into a base layer containing just the large scale features within the shot and a detailed layer finally it merges the two images preserving the natural ambience from the base layer of the nonflash shot while extracting the details from the picture taken with the flash to remove unwanted features from the image such as noise the unexpected variations in color or brightness created by digital cameras the system blurs any undesired pixel with its surrounding neighbors so that it matches those around it in conventional filtering however this means even those pixels at the edges of objects are also blurred which results in a less detailed image but by using what is called a bilateral filter the researchers are able to preserve these outlines rithe says that is because bilateral filters will only blur pixels with their neighbors if they have been assigned a similar brightness value since any objects within the image are likely to have a very different level of brightness than that of their background this prevents the system from blurring across any edges he says to perform each of these tasks the chip s processing unit uses a method of organizing and storing data called a bilateral grid the image is first divided into smaller blocks for each block a histogram is then created this results in a d representation of the image with the x and y axes representing the position of the block and the brightness histogram representing the third dimension this makes it easy for the filter to avoid blurring across edges since pixels with different brightness levels are separated in this third axis in the grid structure no matter how close together they are in the image itself the algorithms implemented on the chip are inspired by the computational photography work of associate professor of computer science and engineering fredo durand and bill freeman a professor of computer science and engineering in mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory with the aid of taiwanese semiconductor

innovative techniques for analyzing that data and big data has received a good deal of credit for barack obama s victory in the last presidential election certainly the term was in heavy use around mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail which in launched a new big data initiative called bigdata csail several of the researchers affiliated with bigdata csail are developing new techniques for processing medical data to make it more accessible to both physicians and patients and to find correlations that could improve diagnosis or choice of therapies peter szolovits a professor in the department of electrical engineering and computer science eecs and the harvard mit division of health sciences and technology hst directs the clinical decision making group at csail which is researching a whole host of methods for bringing artificial intelligence to bear on medical care the group participates in a large initiative sponsored by the national institutes of health to create a database system that would link genomic data and clinical data so that physicians could more easily test hypotheses about connections between genetic variations and particular diseases the group is also investigating ways to automatically extract useful data from doctors free form clinical notes recently the group presented a promising new approach to the problem of word sense disambiguation or inferring from context which of a word s several meanings is intended the word discharge for instance shows up frequently in physicians notes but with radically different meanings the same line of research has spun off several papers on anonymizing medical data automatically stripping it of identifying information to protect patients privacy tracking disease john guttag the dugald c jackson professor in eecs and another member of bigdata csail directs csail s data driven medicine group among other things the group is investigating techniques for detecting and predicting hospital borne infections in several papers last year jenna wiens a graduate student in the group used machine learning techniques to comb through dozens of variables some static such

the one member of bigdata csail who is not already a csail researcher is sandy pentland of the mit media lab pentland s group mines data from portable sensors whether special purpose devices or cellphones to find data pertinent to a whole host of questions from how to improve productivity at large companies to the likelihood that two people who just met will start dating but the same

needs to improve substantially if d technology is to become more mainstream on july a team of researchers from the mit computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail will present two papers at the siggraph computer graphics conference in anaheim california which propose new methods for streamlining and simplifying the d printing process utilizing more efficient intuitive and accessible technologies our goal is to make d printing much easier and less computationally complex said associate professor wojciech matusik co author of the papers and a leader of the computer graphics group at csail ours is the first work that unifies design development and implementation into one seamless process making it possible to easily translate an object from a set of specifications into a fully operational d print d printing poses enormous computational challenges to existing software for starters in order to fabricate complex surfaces containing bumps color gradations and other intricacies printing software must produce an extremely high resolution model of the object with detailed information on each surface that is to be replicated such models often amount to petabytes of data which current programs have difficulty processing and storing to address these challenges matusik and his team developed openfab a programmable pipeline architecture inspired by renderman the software used to design computer generated imagery commonly seen in movies openfab allows for the production of complex structures with varying material properties to specify intricate surface details and the composition of a d object openfab uses fablets programs written in a new programming language that allow users to modify the look and feel of an object easily and efficiently our software pipeline makes it easier to design and print new materials and to continuously vary the properties of the object you are designing said kiril vidim e lead author of one of the two papers and a phd student at csail in traditional manufacturing most objects are composed of multiple parts made out of the same material with openfab the user can change the material consistency of an object for example designing the object to transition from stiff at one end to flexible and compressible at the other end thanks to openfab s streaming architecture data about the design of the d object is computed on demand and sent to the printer as it becomes available with little start up delay so far matusik s research team has been able to replicate a wide array of objects using openfab including an insect embedded in amber a marble table and a squishy teddy bear in order to create lifelike objects that are hard soft reflect light and conform to touch users must currently specify the material composition of the object they wish to replicate this is no easy task as it s often easier to define the desired end state of an object for example saying that an object needs to be soft than to determine which materials should be used in its production to simplify this process matusik and his colleagues developed a new methodology called spec fab instead of requiring explicit design specifications for each region of a print and testing every possible combination spec fab employs a reducer tree which breaks the object down into more manageable chunks spec fab s tuner network then uses the reducer tree to automatically determine the material composition of an object by combining existing computer graphics algorithms matusik s team has used spec fab to create a multitude of d prints creating optical effects like caustic images and objects with specific deformation and textural properties spec fab is a small but powerful toolbox for building algorithms that can produce an endless array of complex printable objects said desai chen a phd student at csail and lead author of one of the papers presented at siggraph the two papers to be presented at siggraph are openfab a

dahleh mitter roozbehani work toward smart policies to pair with smart energy and gridsshare august eecs faculty members munther dahleh eecs associate department head and sanjoy mitter both also members of the laboratory of information and decision systems lids have presented work recently that examines the roll of smart meters and grids in an effort to avoid destabilizing the power grid in relation to pricing policies along with lids research scientist mardavij roozbehani dahleh and mitter have presented their work volatility of power grids under real time pricing at a recent ieee conference on decision and control read more in the mit news office august article reproduced below title the too smart for its own good grid new technologies intended to boost reliance on renewable energy could destabilize the power grid if they re not matched with careful pricing policies by mit news office writer larry hardesty in the last few years electrical utilities have begun equipping their customers homes with new meters that have internet connections and increased computational capacity one envisioned application of these smart meters is to give customers real time information about fluctuations in the price of electricity which might encourage them to defer some energy intensive tasks until supply is high or demand is low less of the energy produced from erratic renewable sources such as wind and solar would thus be wasted and utilities would less frequently fire up backup generators which are not only more expensive to operate but tend to be more polluting too recent work by researchers in mit s laboratory for information and decision systems however shows that this policy could backfire if too many people set appliances to turn on or devices to recharge when the price of electricity crosses the same threshold it could cause a huge spike in demand in the worst case that could bring down the power grid fortunately in a paper presented at the last ieee conference on decision and control the researchers also show that some relatively simple types of price controls could prevent huge swings in demand but that stability would come at the cost of some of the efficiencies that real time pricing is intended to provide today customers receive monthly electrical bills that indicate the cost of electricity as a three to six month average in fact however the price that power producers charge utilities fluctuates every five minutes or so according to market conditions the electrical system is thus what control theorists call an open loop price varies according to demand but demand doesn t vary according to price smart meters could close that loop drastically changing the dynamics of the system taking control research scientist mardavij roozbehani and professors sanjoy mitter and munther dahleh assumed that every consumer has a utility function describing how inconvenient it is for him or her to defer electricity usage while that function will vary from person to person individual utility functions can be pooled into a single collective function for an entire population the researchers assumed that on average consumers will seek to maximize the difference between the utility function and the cost of electricity that is they ll try to get as much convenience for as little money as possible what they found was that if consumer response to price fluctuation is large enough to significantly alter patterns of energy use and if it s not there s no point in installing smart meters then price variations well within the normal range can cause dangerous oscillations in demand for the system to work supply and demand must match almost perfectly at each instant of time roozbehani says the generators have what are called ramp constraints they cannot ramp up their production arbitrarily fast and they cannot ramp it down arbitrarily fast if these oscillations become very wild they ll have a hard time keeping track of the demand and that s bad for everyone the researchers model however also indicates that at least partially shielding consumers from the volatility of the market could tame those oscillations for instance roozbehani explains utilities could give consumers price updates every hour or so instead of every five minutes or he says if the prices in the wholesale market are varying very widely i pass the consumer a price that reflects the wholesale market conditions but not to that extent if the prices in the wholesale market just doubled i don t give the consumer a price that is double the previous time interval but a price that is slightly higher according to roozbehani the same theoretical framework that he and his colleagues adopt in their paper should enable the analysis and development of practical pricing models the trade off but minimizing the risks of giving consumers real time pricing information also diminishes the benefits possibly when you need an aggressive response from the consumers say the wind drops you re not going to get it roozbehani says one way to improve that trade off roozbehani explains would be for customers to actually give utilities information about how they would respond to different prices at different times utilities could then tune the prices that they pass to consumers much more precisely to maximize responsiveness to fluctuations in the market while minimizing the risk of instability collecting that information would be difficult but roozbehani s hunch is that the benefits would outweigh the costs he s currently working on expanding his model so that it factors in the value of information to see if his hunch is right as far as i know very very few people are analyzing the dynamics of electricity markets with experience from control theory says eugene litvinov senior director of business architecture and technology at iso new england the organization that oversees the operation of the electrical grid in the six new england states

engineers two technologies to combat drug resistant bacteriashare september in a two pronged attack on the killer superbugs that have become nearly unstoppable tim lu associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and principal investigator in mit s research lab of electronics has not only developed a gene editing system that can selectively kill the bacteria carrying harmful genes that confer antibiotic resistance or cause disease but also devised a way of identifying combinations of genes that work together to make bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics image a scanning electron micrograph depicts numerous clumps of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteria commonly referred to by the acronym mrsa credit janice haney carr centers for disease control and prevention courtesy tim lu mit news read more in the sept mit news office article by anne trafton titled battling superbugs two new technologies could enable novel strategies for combating drug resistant bacteria also posted below in recent years new strains of bacteria have emerged that resist even the most powerful antibiotics each year these superbugs including drug resistant forms of tuberculosis and staphylococcus infect more than million people nationwide and kill at least despite the urgent need for new treatments scientists have discovered very few new classes of antibiotics in the past decade mit engineers have now turned a powerful new weapon on these superbugs using a gene editing system that can disable any target gene they have shown that they can selectively kill bacteria carrying harmful genes that confer antibiotic resistance or cause disease led by timothy lu an associate professor of biological engineering and electrical engineering and computer science the researchers described their findings in the sept issue of nature biotechnology last month lu s lab reported a different approach to combating resistant bacteria by identifying combinations of genes that work together to make bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics lu hopes that both technologies will lead to new drugs to help fight the growing crisis posed by drug resistant bacteria this is a pretty crucial moment when there are fewer and fewer new antibiotics available but more and more antibiotic resistance evolving he says we ve been interested in finding new ways to combat antibiotic resistance and these papers offer two different strategies for doing that cutting out resistance most antibiotics work by interfering with crucial functions such as cell division or protein synthesis however some bacteria including the formidable mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and cre carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae organisms have evolved to become virtually untreatable with existing drugs in the new nature biotechnology study graduate students robert citorik and mark mimee worked with lu to target specific genes that allow bacteria to survive antibiotic treatment the crispr genome editing system presented the perfect strategy to go after those genes crispr originally discovered by biologists studying the bacterial immune system involves a set of proteins that bacteria use to defend themselves against bacteriophages viruses that infect bacteria one of these proteins a dna cutting enzyme called cas binds to short rna guide strands that target specific sequences telling cas where to make its cuts lu and colleagues decided to turn bacteria s own weapons against them they designed their rna guide strands to target genes for antibiotic resistance including the enzyme ndm which allows bacteria to resist a broad range of beta lactam antibiotics including carbapenems the genes encoding ndm and other antibiotic resistance factors are usually carried on plasmids circular strands of dna separate from the bacterial genome making it easier for them to spread through populations when the researchers turned the crispr system against ndm they were able to specifically kill more than percent of ndm carrying bacteria while antibiotics to which the bacteria were resistant did not induce any significant killing they also successfully targeted another antibiotic resistance gene encoding shv a mutation in the bacterial chromosome providing resistance to quinolone antibiotics and a virulence factor in enterohemorrhagic e coli in addition the researchers showed that the crispr system could be used to selectively remove specific bacteria from diverse bacterial communities based on their genetic signatures thus opening up the potential for microbiome editing beyond antimicrobial applications to get the crispr components into bacteria the researchers created two delivery vehicles engineered bacteria that carry crispr genes on plasmids and bacteriophage particles that bind to the bacteria and inject the genes both of these carriers successfully spread the crispr genes through the population of drug resistant bacteria delivery of the crispr system into waxworm larvae infected with a harmful form of e coli resulted in increased survival of the larvae the researchers are now testing this approach in mice and they envision that eventually the technology could be adapted to deliver the crispr components to treat infections or remove other unwanted bacteria in human patients this work represents a very interesting genetic method for killing antibiotic resistant bacteria in a directed fashion which in principle could help to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance fueled by excessive broad spectrum treatment says ahmad khalil an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at boston university who was not part of the research team high speed genetic screens another tool lu has developed to fight antibiotic resistance is a technology called combigem this system described in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the week of aug allows scientists to rapidly and systematically search for genetic combinations that sensitize bacteria to different antibiotics to test the system lu and his graduate student allen cheng created a library of pairs of bacterial genes all of these genes code for transcription factors which are proteins that control the expression of other genes each gene pair is contained on a single piece of dna that also includes a six base pair barcode for each gene these barcodes allow the researchers to rapidly identify the genes in each pair

rinard and team devise jolt to save data from infinite loop hang upsshare tuesday august all day martin rinard professor of computer science in the electrical engineering and computer science department and principal investigator in the computer science and artificial intelligence laboroatry csail at mit has created a new tool to avoid data loss and other issues when a computer program gets hung up on an infinite loop rinard and his graduate students michael carbin sasa misailovic and michael klin developed the work titled detecting and escaping innite loops with jolt which they presented at the july th european conference on object oriented programming in lancaster england read more below as it appears in the mit news office august article by larry hardesty its happened to everyone youre using a familiar piece of software to do something youve done a thousand times before say find a particular word in a document and all of a sudden the program just stops working you click the cursor and move the mouse but nothing changes on screen and finally you just quit the program losing whatever work youd done since the last time you saved often a stalled program has gone into what computer scientists call an infinite loop where it keeps executing a single block of code over and over at the th european conference on object oriented programming in lancaster england in july researchers from mits computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail presented a new tool that automatically interrupts infinite loops and moves on to the next line of code in the computer program in tests their system restored five different programs to stable enough states that data could be saved and the programs exited safely in the majority of cases the programs also provided at least a partial solution to the computations they were trying to perform when they got hung up loops are among the most basic building blocks of computer programs they allow a programmer to specify in a single step a procedure that has to be performed on many pieces of data in sequence for instance the search function in a word processor might have to look at thousands of individual letters in even a fairly short document comparing each of them to the letters in a search term if it doesnt find a match it will move onto the next letter and loop back to re execute the code that does the comparing wheel spinning a commercial program might contain tens of thousands of loops and a slight error in the code for any one of them could lead to an infinite loop in which the computer doesnt know when to stop repeating the same operation computer science professor martin rinard and his graduate students michael carbin sasa misailovic and michael kling developed a software tool that they call jolt which recognizes infinite loops by monitoring the programs use of memory a computer user whos worried that his or her computer has entered an infinite loop could activate jolt which would take a series of snapshots of the computers memory after each iteration of a loop the snapshots could be completely different explains carbin who is first author on the paper that can be an indicator that your program is computing it may be doing something useful for you so maybe you dont want to break out of this but if its not and it has exactly the same state then clearly its stuck in an infinite loop jolt works in conjunction with a compiler a program that translates code written in a high level programming language into rudimentary instructions that a computer can understand when an application is being compiled jolt marks the beginnings and ends of all the loops indicated in the source code if the compiled application later stalls jolt simply forces it to skip ahead to the first instruction following the loop its stuck in keeping tabs on all the loops in a program however causes it to run or percent slower carbin says and getting commercial software developers to use jolt when compiling their code could be a tall order so the csail researchers are working on a version of jolt that operates directly on compiled applications whose instructions consist entirely of fixed length sequences of binary numbers this binary version of jolt the researchers explain will be called bolt course correction bolt uses the same infinite loop detection mechanism that jolt did and in early tests it seems to work well with binary files the steeper challenge is determining what instruction to jump to once a loop has been identified a function written in a high level programming language might invoke other functions which could invoke still other functions but at the binary level those nested function calls just look like a long list of numbers figuring out where one function ends and another begins is no easy task but kling has developed a clever algorithm that can identify the highest level function in operation at a given time the one that has initiated all the others which could help bolt orient itself and even if the system cant make an informed decision rinard explains it could just start hopping around to new instructions at random until it finds one that breaks the impasse randomly modifying code on the fly may sound antithetical to the whole idea of computer engineering but its an approach thats paid off for rinards group in research on websites that can weather malicious attacks and software that adjusts to changing hardware conditions among other things the vast majority of software engineering or programming language researchers are shackled to this notion of full correctness or full soundness you cant change anything in the program if theres even the possibility of getting a slightly wrong answer says westley weimer an assistant professor

nov of cancer he was years old driven by a deeply felt sense of responsibility to mit the nation and society as a whole staelin dedicated his long career to basic science technology development service education and entrepreneurship his career was that of abundant accomplishment and widespread impact staelin was born and raised in toledo oh came to mit at the age of as a freshman and remained at the institute for the rest of his life staelin s career as a junior faculty started in radio astronomy among his first accomplishments in he developed a computationally efficient algorithm that enabled him to discover the crab nebula pulsar helping to confirm the existence of neutron stars predicted by theoretical physics over time his interests expanded to include remote sensing to enable climate monitoring to which he brought together a strong command of electromagnetics signal processing methodology and computation trends among the many examples of his leadership in this field he was principal investigator in the development of the first two earth orbiting microwave imaging spectrometers launched in for mapping global temperature and humidity through clouds he was also a co investigator on the nasa voyager and spacecraft missions studying non thermal radio emission from the outer planets later still during he co developed techniques for using operational millimeter wave sounding satellites for more frequent and complete mapping of global precipitation in subsequent years he turned his attention to diverse collections of important emerging problems that required the application of sophisticated signal processing and estimation theory these included the development of practical image and video compression technology advanced methodologies for data rich manufacturing problems which he pursued under the mit leaders for manufacturing program heterogeneous and wireless communication architectures and most recently neuronal computation models staelin was an active member of the mit community he served on numerous committees and took on important leadership roles later in his career staelin served as assistant directory of mit lincoln laboratory for years where he focused on helping both enhancing the long range focus of the laboratory and strengthening its ties to campus he also served as a member of the u s presidents information technology advisory committee staelin was a dedicated teacher who helped educate generations of electrical engineers his focus for many years was the undergraduate electromagnetic curriculum he co authored the prentice hall text electromagnetic waves with ann w morgenthaler and jin au kong staelin was a thoughtful and patient mentor greatly loved and admired by his students he supervised many doctoral masters and undergraduate student theses almost graduate theses alone and a large number of alumni of his group have gone on to careers in academia and industry of great distinction and striking impact as researchers and scientists entrepreneurs technical leaders and executivesa testament to his skillful training of them highly entrepreneurial staelin started and directed three pioneering companies with colleagues and students over his career the first was environmental research and technology ert now part of aecom one of the first and largest environmental services companies specializing initially in air quality and ultimately addressing the full spectrum of environmental issues the second was picturetel now part of polycom itself founded by one of staelin s former students which pioneered cost effective video conferencing systems based on sophisticated video compression technology this technology ultimately formed the basis for the ubiquitous video compression standards that today enable the widespread availability of video content over networks staelins third foray was in the area of personal transportation where he founded empower purchased by zap which developed novel electric scooter technology following these experiences in staelin co founded mit s pioneering venture mentoring service to help early stage mit companies and aspiring mit entrepreneurs benefit from the advice of experienced mit alumni and more generally to support entrepreneurial activity within the mit community as a furthering of mit s educational mission vms has served more than companies to date helping them raise almost b in capital and has become a model for other similarly oriented university and government agencies staelin s last project was a collaboration on neural computation with son carl h staelin which resulted in monograph currently in press entitled models for neural spike computation and cognition staelinfest an event held at mit in july to celebrate staelin s extraordinary career was widely attended by many faculty colleagues and former students from all over the country at the event he also received the distinguished john howard dellinger medal awarded to him by the international union of radio science ursi for profound contributions to remote sensing over his career staelin was also a fellow of ieee and aaas staelin s instinctively self effacing nature and his tendency to eschew the spotlight were in many ways the secret to his unusual effectiveness indeed he was the living embodiment of the maxim that you can

touched many of the technological advances of the th century he began his career as an engineer with general motors in lockport n y and subsequently taught electrical engineering at manhattan college in new york city reintjes playfully described himself in a interview for the mit laboratory for information and decision systems as the man who came to dinner and never left the dinner was a gathering in boston of the institute for radio engineers at which he met and was later invited by dr w l barrow of mit to become involved in the new radar school at mit he arranged for a leave of absence from his position at manhattan college and joined mit in other than a year at general electric in reintjes stuck with academia and returned to mit on a faculty appointment in over his year association with mit reintjes research interests expanded from the areas of radar and electronics and early information storage and retrieval to applications of computer communications technologies after five years working as a research staff member in the research lab of electronics reintjes was approached by prof gordon s brown who was moving on to head the dept of electrical engineering at mit to take on the directorship of the servo lab brown had founded this lab in at the request of the us navy for emphasis on servomechanisms and fire control reintjes accepted and remained for years as the servo lab grew under reintjes leadership the emphasis focused increasingly on computerization of numerical control using the whirlwind i computer reintjes and colleague douglas t ross ms developed an automatic programming system for numerical control in two dimensions collectively known as automatically programmed tools apt reintjes and ross built the apt system to the point that the only way to proceed was through wide introduction to private industry and by seventeen companies were involved although he referred to the early servo lab as a kind of military job shop reintjes was well aware of the need to build its theoretical and academic side with added faculty through the s the lab renamed the electronic systems laboratory esl in became a haven for not only masters but for doctoral studies annual reports in the s gave testament thesis research averaged per year not only in electrical engineering but spilling into chemical and mechanical engineering physics mathematics biology nutrition and

advance information storage and retrieval in libraries in a sense reintjes had launched the first search engine system using general purpose computers to locate research in professional literature reintjes interest in pairing academia with industry throughout his career eventually paved the way for his taking on directorship in of the mit vi a cooperative internship program in electrical engineering he opened up the program by putting admission to the vi a ms degree on the same academic requirements scale as admission throughout the ee department and spread the scope of administrative

department head anantha chandrakasan and associate department heads bill freeman silvio micali and david perreault announced in february the promotions of eight faculty members in the department professors adalsteinsson daniel golland and torralba are promoted to full professor professors chilpala polyanskiy and vaikuntanathan are promoted to associate professor the promotions are effective july elfar adalsteinsson is a world leader in the development and application of magnetic resonance imaging mri the primary goal of his research is to advance the physics and engineering of mri to develop new methods and instruments that can be deployed in the clinic a remarkable feature of his work is that it spans the spectrum from studies of the basic physics of mri and the development of enabling technologies to testing and application of new imaging modalities in the clinic for example he has been a leader in both the development of parallel rf transmission to realize improved mri scanning and in development of methods for measuring parameters associated with oxygenation in the brain he is also an excellent teacher and has been responsible for both developing an mri course for graduate students and senior undergraduates hst and along with his colleagues co lead development of the new undergraduate course introduction to eecs from a medical perspective s luca daniel works on computational techniques for modeling and design of complex systems including for microsystems e g integrated circuit modeling and design and biomedical applications e g electromagnetic analysis for magnetic resonance imaging his research encompasses the development of computationally efficient integral equations solvers e g field solvers parameterized model order reduction techniques and methods for uncertainty quantification and their embodiment in useful software tools his work has been widely recognized most recently in a best paper award from the ieee transactions on computer aided design and is having tremendous practical impact in applications such as rapid electromagnetic field prediction for mri scanners he has also made key educational contributions including heavily updating and expanding the content of mit s flagship class on numerical simulation j and working with colleagues to revamp the department s undergraduate header course electromagnetics and applications polina golland studies the shape and functions of biological structures through the statistical analysis of biomedical images she builds computational models of the anatomical and functional variability within populations and develops methods to detect and characterize changes in those distributions under the influence of development or disease her models give insight into the functional organization of the brain and into the causes of its variability her group releases open source software packages for wide impact and dissemination prof golland has played a major role in developing three important classes in our eecs curriculum two very popular graduate classes on inference and information and the department s new undergraduate class on inference jing kong is an expert on the synthesis of low dimensionality d and d materials using chemical vapor deposition cvd for example her widely cited work at mit on cvd growth of single and few layer graphene films is considered foundational and has led to the ability to grow large area high quality graphene films and transfer them onto arbitrary substrates assisting the explosive growth in the field she is making similarly important contributions to cvd synthesis of few layer hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides such as mos moreover through extensive collaborations she is having substantial impact on the engineering application of these new materials in many kinds of systems prof kong is also a highly dedicated teacher who is liked by students and colleagues alike and has contributed to the new undergraduate graduate class introduction to nanoelectronics and created a new graduate level class science technology and applications of carbon nanoelectronics antonio torralba has received wide recognition for pointing out the importance of context for object recognition that the objects near another object help us to recognize the object itself and developing techniques to exploit context in collaboration with aude oliva they introduced scene recognition as an area of study within computer vision and developed a representation designed to capture such contextual information prof torralba developed several widely used datasets that help to advance the field since tenure he has continued with very strong research contributions deepening his work on scene understanding analyzing image features studying database bias and exploring computational photography his teaching is strong and he has contributed new courses within his research area and to the deparment s large introduction to eecs class adam chlipala s research addresses the software development process applying formal logic to prove programs are correct using a computer proof assistant he aims to reduce the human cost of program verification so that it may one day become a standard part of software development this research could ultimately increase the reliability and security of software he

singling out sounds depends on our inner ear s nanoporesshare march dennis freeman professor of electrical engineering and a team of researchers in mit s research laboratory of electronics have

our ability to tune in to a single voice inner ear membrane uses tiny pores to mechanically separate sounds researchers find also posted below in its entirety the optical microscope image above left depicts wave motion in a cross section of the tectorial membrane part of the inner ear this membrane is a microscale gel smaller in width than a single human hair and it plays a key role in stimulating sensory receptors of the inner ear waves traveling on this membrane control our ability to separate sounds of varying pitch and intensity image courtesy of mit s micromechanic s group mit news office even in a crowded room full of background noise the human ear is remarkably adept at tuning in to a single voice a feat that has proved remarkably difficult for computers to match a new analysis of the underlying mechanisms conducted by researchers at mit has provided insights that could ultimately lead to better machine hearing and perhaps to better hearing aids as well our ears selectivity it turns out arises from evolution s precise tuning of a tiny membrane inside the inner ear called the tectorial membrane the viscosity of this membrane its firmness or lack thereof depends on the size and distribution of tiny pores just a few tens of nanometers wide this in turn provides mechanical filtering that helps to sort out specific sounds the new findings are reported in the biophysical journal by a team led by mit graduate student jonathan sellon and including research scientist roozbeh ghaffari former graduate student shirin farrahi and professor of electrical engineering dennis freeman the team collaborated with biologist guy richardson of the university of sussex elusive understanding in discriminating among competing sounds the human ear is extraordinary compared to conventional speech and sound recognition technologies freeman says the exact reasons have remained elusive but the importance of the tectorial membrane located inside the cochlea or inner ear has become clear in recent years largely through the work of freeman and his colleagues now it seems that a flawed assumption contributed to the longstanding difficulty in understanding the importance of this membrane much of our ability to differentiate among sounds is frequency based freeman says so researchers had assumed that the better we could resolve frequency the better we could hear but this assumption turns out not always to be true in fact freeman and his co authors previously found that tectorial membranes with a certain genetic defect are actually highly sensitive to variations in frequency and the result is worse hearing not better the mit team found a fundamental tradeoff between how well you can resolve different frequencies and how long it takes to do it freeman explains that makes the finer frequency discrimination too slow to be useful in real world sound selectivity too fast for neurons previous work by freeman and colleagues has shown that the tectorial membrane plays a fundamental role in sound discrimination by carrying waves that stimulate a particular kind of sensory receptor this process is essential in deciphering competing sounds but it takes place too quickly for neural processes to keep pace nature over the course of evolution appears to have produced a very effective electromechanical system freeman says that can keep up with the speed of these sound waves the new work explains how the membrane s structure determines how well it filters sound the team studied two genetic variants that cause nanopores within the tectorial membrane to be smaller or larger than normal the pore size affects the viscosity of the membrane and its sensitivity to different frequencies the tectorial membrane is spongelike riddled with tiny pores by studying how its viscosity varies with pore size the team was able to determine that the typical pore size observed in mice about nanometers across represents an optimal size for combining frequency discrimination with overall sensitivity pores that are larger or smaller impair hearing it really changes the way we think about this structure ghaffari says the new findings show that fluid viscosity and pores are actually essential to its performance changing the sizes of tectorial membrane nanopores via biochemical manipulation or other means can provide unique ways to alter hearing sensitivity and frequency discrimination william brownell a professor of otolaryngology at baylor college of medicine says this is the first study to suggest that porosity may affect cochlear tuning this work he adds could provide insight into the development of specific hearing problems the research was supported by the national institutes of health the national science foundation and the

shapiro team demonstrate effective quantum data transmissionshare may jeffrey shapiro the julius a stratton professor of electrical engineering working with members of the optical and quantum communications group of which he is a co director in the research laboratory of electronics at mit has demonstrated experimentally the effectiveness of a new quantum communication protocol the group has shown in a series of papers the system s effectiveness in both security against passive eavesdropping and can be used for greater distances than the current quantum key distribution qkd read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled making quantum encryption practical an mit team that proposed a new more practical scheme for using quantum physics to secure data transmission has now demonstrated it experimentally posted below one of the many promising applications of quantum mechanics in the information sciences is quantum key distribution qkd in which the counterintuitive behavior of quantum particles guarantees that no one can eavesdrop on a private exchange of data without detection as its name implies qkd is intended for the distribution of cryptographic keys that can be used for ordinary nonquantum cryptography that s because it requires the transmission of a huge number of bits for each one that s successfully received that kind of inefficiency is tolerable for key distribution but not for general purpose communication also because qkd depends on the properties of individual light particles photons it s very vulnerable to signal loss which is inevitable over large enough distances although qkd systems have been built some commercially they generally work across distances of only miles or so in a series of recent papers researchers in the optical and quantum communications group at mit s research laboratory of electronics described a new quantum communication protocol that could solve both of these problems it s much more resilient to signal loss than qkd and it sends only one bit for every one received in the latest issue of physical review letters they describe the first experimental implementation of their system which bore out all their theoretical predictions at present the protocol does have one major caveat it s secure only against so called passive eavesdroppers who simply siphon light from an optical transmission and not against active eavesdroppers who maliciously inject their own light into a communication channel security against passive eavesdropping is probably adequate for some optical communication systems but if the researchers can figure out how to thwart active eavesdroppers too their protocol could be used to secure optical data transmission over long distances cascading correlations like all quantum information schemes the new protocol exploits the central mystery of quantum physics the ability of tiny particles of matter to inhabit mutually exclusive states at the same time electrons for instance have a property called spin which describes how they act in a magnetic field spin can be either up or down but it can also be in a strange quantum state known as superposition in which it s up and down simultaneously according to jeffrey shapiro the julius a stratton professor of electrical engineering and one of the co directors of the optical and quantum communications group quantum particles are capable of a greater degree of correlation than objects described by classical physics a coin for instance can be either face up or face down if you glue a second coin to it face to face the states of the two coins are correlated if one is up the other is down and vice versa in the same way if two electrons are orbiting the nucleus of an atom at the same distance their spins are correlated if one is up the other must be down but there s a third possibility if one is up and down at the same time so is the other this kind of mutual dependency even in particles separated by great distances is known as entanglement but entanglement is very fragile it begins to break down as soon as particles start interacting with their immediate environments the key to the new protocol shapiro explains is that even if the entanglement between two light beams breaks down and their degree of correlation falls back within classical limits it can still remain much higher than it would be if the beams had a merely classical correlation to begin with bring the noise following cryptographic convention the rle researchers describe their protocol in terms of a secure communication between alice and bob with an eavesdropper named eve trying to listen in alice creates two entangled light beams and sends one of them to bob keeping the other one circulating locally in classical physics there s a maximum amount of correlation you can get between two events shapiro says in the new protocol however the entangled beams have a correlation that

csail news katabi adib develop wi vi to track moving humans even behind wallsshare july eecs faculty member dina katabi principal investigator in the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail and her graduate student fadel adib have developed a system dubbed wi vi which uses low cost wireless technology to detect and track moving humans behind walls katabi and adib will present this work at a sigcomm conference in hong kong in august read more in the june mit news article by helen knight titled new system uses low power wi fi signal to track moving humans even behind walls wi vi is based on a concept similar to radar and sonar imaging also posted below in its entirety the comic book hero superman uses his x ray vision to spot bad guys lurking behind walls and other objects now we could all have x ray vision thanks to researchers at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory researchers have long attempted to build a device capable of seeing people through walls however previous efforts to develop such a system have involved the use of expensive and bulky radar technology that uses a part of the electromagnetic spectrum only available to the military now a system being developed by dina katabi a professor in mit s department of electrical engineering and computer science and her graduate student fadel adib could give all of us the ability to spot people in different rooms using low cost wi fi technology we wanted to create a device that is low power portable and simple enough for anyone to use to give people the ability to see through walls and closed doors katabi says the system called wi vi is based on a concept similar to radar and sonar imaging but in contrast to radar and sonar it transmits a low power wi fi signal and uses its reflections to track moving humans it can do so even if the humans are in closed rooms or hiding behind a wall as a wi fi signal is transmitted at a wall a portion of the signal penetrates through it reflecting off any humans on the other side however only a tiny fraction of the signal makes it through to the other room with the rest being reflected by the wall or by other objects so we had to come up with a technology that could cancel out all these other reflections and keep only those from the moving human body katabi says motion detector to do this the system uses two transmit antennas and a single receiver the two antennas transmit almost identical signals except that the signal from the second antenna is the inverse of the first as a result the two signals interfere with each other in such a way as to cancel each other out since any static objects that the signals hit including the wall create identical reflections they too are cancelled out by this nulling effect in this way only those reflections that change between the two signals such as those from a moving object arrive back at the receiver adib says so if the person moves behind the wall all reflections from static objects are cancelled out and the only thing registered by the device is the moving human once the system has cancelled out all of the reflections from static objects it can then concentrate on tracking the person as he or she moves around the room most previous attempts to track moving targets through walls have done so using an array of spaced antennas which each capture the signal reflected off a person moving through the environment but this would be too expensive and bulky for use in a handheld device so instead wi vi uses just one receiver as the person moves through the room his or her distance from the receiver changes meaning the time it takes for the reflected signal to make its way back to the receiver changes too the system then uses this information to calculate where the person is at any one time possible uses in disaster recovery personal safety gaming wi vi being presented at the sigcomm conference in hong kong in august could be used to help search and rescue teams to find survivors trapped in rubble after an earthquake say or to allow police officers to identify the number and movement of criminals within a building to avoid walking into an ambush it could also be used as a personal safety device katabi says if you are walking at night and you have the feeling that someone is following you then you could use it to check if there is someone behind the fence or behind a corner the device can also detect gestures or movements by a person standing behind a wall such as a wave of the arm katabi says this would allow it to be used as a gesture based interface for controlling lighting or appliances within the home such as turning off the lights in another room with a wave of the arm venkat padmanabhan a principal researcher at microsoft research says the possibility of using wi vi as a gesture based interface that does not require a line of sight between the user and the device itself is perhaps its most interesting application of all such an interface could alter the face of gaming he says unlike today s interactive gaming devices where users must stay in front of the console and its camera at all times users could still interact with the system while in another room for example this could open up the possibility of more complex and interesting games katabi says mit electrical engineering

spectrum policy with federal communications commission fcc chairman julius genachowski professors hari balakrishnan and dina katabi co directors of wireless mit spoke with genachowski on topics ranging from america s performance in the broadband market to the importance of wireless policy followed by questions from audience members who packed into the kirsch auditorium in the stata center genachowski kicked off the event by explaining his own personal connection to mit a native of brookline mass genachowski s father received his master s in mechanical engineering at the institute genachowski recalled how as a teenager his father took him on a trip to mit specifically the barker engineering library there he showed genachowski his thesis which outlined plans for a device that could help blind people read the words on a page by translating the text into physical signals while his father s plans never came to fruition genachowski was inspired by the work which showed him the power of communications technology to help people it s an ideal that continues to motivate his work to this day in his remarks genachowski noted america s recent achievements in broadband four years ago genachowski explained much of the activity and innovations in the mobile field were happening in countries like japan today the united states has leapfrogged other countries genachowski said and much of the innovation in the wireless field stems from this country especially in areas like the creation of new mobile applications and g usage there remains a need for forward looking spectrum policies he said due to the increased demand and growth in wireless in order for the united states to continue to lead the wireless movement and to meet current demands more spectrum must be freed up internet openness must be preserved and the speed and capacity of wired and wireless networks must be increased spectrum is essential infrastructure for our modern economy genachowski said when asked about the importance of wireless spectrum policy mobile infrastructure does not work without spectrum genachowski referenced two innovations in wireless policy that helped pave the way for today s mobile environment the introduction of spectrum auctions and unlicensed spectrum use according to genachowski the u s needs more policies like these including incentive auctions more efficient use of spectrum and sharing of government spectrum to help develop the next generation of wireless technologies he added that he expects the introduction of incentivized auctions which would allow television broadcasters to sell unused spectrum will free up a significant amount of spectrum for licensed and unlicensed use genachowski also announced plans to allow for nationwide use of white spaces or spectrum allocated to a broadcasting company that is not in use genachowski credited the availability of unlicensed spectrum as providing a platform for researchers to develop such technologies as bluetooth and wi fi and expressed hopes that this technological innovation will continue taking questions from the audience genachowski spoke on everything from the planned expansion of the ghz bandwidth to whether he believes an engineer would make a good fcc commissioner yes when asked about the benefits of communications technology in helping people with disabilities genachowski explained that the fcc is currently working on changing the process so that the needs of people with disabilities are taken into consideration earlier in the research and development process when asked about what would happen if there was not sufficient spectrum to meet current demands genachowski credited mit researchers for tackling the problem there is research going on at mit that goes directly at this problem genachowski said referencing new projects at wireless mit that improve the quality of video streaming allow for spectrum sharing and increase throughput in wireless networks wireless mit based in the mit computer science and artificial intelligence lab csail was launched last october with the goal of addressing the most important challenges facing the wireless and mobile computing fields in particular the spectrum crunch researchers aim to develop new techniques for overcoming the exhaustion of radio airwaves or spectrum caused by the explosive popularity of wireless systems

rle website mit engineers have transformed bacterial cells into living calculators that can compute logarithms divide and take square roots using three or fewer genetic parts inspired by how analog electronic circuits function the researchers created synthetic computation circuits by combining existing genetic parts or engineered genes in novel ways the circuits perform those calculations in an analog fashion by exploiting natural biochemical functions that are already present in the cell rather than by reinventing them with digital logic thus making them more efficient than the digital circuits pursued by most synthetic biologists according to rahul sarpeshkar and timothy lu the two senior authors on the paper describing the circuits in the may online edition of nature in analog you compute on a continuous set of numbers which means it s not just black and white it s gray as well says sarpeshkar an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and the head of the analog circuits and biological systems group at mit analog computation would be particularly useful for designing cellular sensors for pathogens or other molecules the researchers say analog sensing could also be combined with digital circuits to create cells that can take a specific action triggered by a threshold concentration of certain molecules you could do a lot of upfront sensing with the analog circuits because they re very rich and a relatively small amount of parts can give you a lot of complexity and have that output go into a circuit that makes a decision is this true or not says lu an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science and biological engineering lead author of the nature paper is mit postdoc ramiz daniel jacob rubens a graduate student in microbiology analog advantages sarpeshkar has previously identified thermodynamic similarities between analog transistor circuits and the chemical circuits that take place inside cells in he took advantage of those similarities to model biological interactions between dna and proteins in an electronic circuit using only eight transistors in the new nature paper sarpeshkar lu and colleagues have done the reverse mapping analog electronic circuits onto cells sarpeshkar has long advocated analog computing as a more efficient alternative to digital computation at the moderate precision of computation seen in biology these analog circuits are efficient because they can take in a continuous range of inputs and they exploit the natural continuous computing functions that are already present in cells in the case of cells that continuous input might be the amount of glucose present in transistors it s a range of continuous input currents or voltages digital circuits meanwhile represent every value as zero or one ignoring the range of possibilities in between this can be useful for creating circuits that perform logic functions such as and not and or inside cells which many synthetic biologists have done these circuits can reveal whether or not a threshold level of a certain molecule is present but not the exact amount of it digital circuits also require many more parts which can drain the energy of the cell hosting them if you build too many parts to make some function the cell is not going to have the energy to keep making those proteins sarpeshkar says doing the math to create an analog adding or multiplying circuit that can calculate the total quantity of two or more compounds in a cell the researchers combined two circuits each of which responds to a different input in one circuit a sugar called arabinose turns on a transcription factor that activates the gene that codes for green fluorescent protein gfp in the second a signaling molecule known as ahl also turns on a gene that produces gfp by measuring the total amount of gfp the total amount of both inputs can be calculated to subtract or divide the researchers swapped one of the activator transcription factors with a repressor which turns off production of gfp when the input molecule is present the team also built an analog square root circuit that requires just two parts while a recently reported digital synthetic circuit for performing square roots had more than analog computation is very efficient sarpeshkar says to create digital circuits at a comparable level of precision would take many more genetic parts another of the team s circuits can perform division by calculating the ratio of two different molecules cells often perform this kind of computation on their own which is critical for monitoring the relative concentrations of molecules such as nad and nadh which are frequently converted from one to the other as they help other cellular reactions take place that ratio is important for controlling a lot of cellular processes and the cell naturally has enzymes that can recognize those ratios lu says cells can already do a lot of these things on their own but for them to do it over a useful range requires extra engineering that extra engineering included modifying the circuits so that they can compute with

weinstein popa make frequency hopping radios practicalshare may dana weinstein the steven g and renee finn career development assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science and laura popa a graduate student in physics at the mit microsystems technology laboratory mtl have developed a new method for manufacturing hardware based radio signal filtration their work should improve filtration performance while enabling times as many filters per chip weinstein and popa will be presenting this work in june at the international conference on solid state sensors actuators and microsystems read more in the may mit news office article by larry hardesty titled making frequency hopping radios practical new hardware could lead to wireless devices that identify and exploit unused transmission frequencies using radio spectrum much more efficiently posted below the way in which radio spectrum is currently allocated to different wireless technologies can lead to gross inefficiencies in some regions for instance the frequencies used by cellphones can be desperately congested while large swaths of the broadcast television spectrum stand idle one solution to that problem is the year old idea of cognitive radio in which wireless devices would scan their environments for vacant frequencies and use these for transmissions different proposals for cognitive radio place different emphases on hardware and software but the chief component of many hardware approaches is a bank of filters that can isolate any frequency in a wide band researchers at mit s microsystems technology laboratory mtl have developed a new method for manufacturing such filters that should improve their performance while enabling times as many of them to be crammed on a single chip that s a vital consideration in handheld devices where space is tight but just as important the new method uses techniques already common in the production of signal processing chips so it should be easy for manufacturers to adopt there are two main approaches to hardware based radio signal filtration one is to perform the filtration electronically the other is to convert the radio signal to an acoustic signal a physical vibration and then convert it back to an electrical signal in work to be presented in june at the international conference on solid state sensors actuators and microsystems dana weinstein the steven g and renee finn career development assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science and laura popa a graduate student in physics adopted the second approach resonant ideas both types of filtration use devices called resonators and acoustic resonators have a couple of clear advantages over electronic ones one is that their filtration is more precise if i pluck a guitar string that s the easiest resonator to think of it s going to resonate at some frequency and it s going to die down due to losses weinstein explains that loss is related to basically energy leaked away from that resonance mode into all other frequencies less loss means better frequency selectivity and mechanical acoustic resonators have less loss than electrical resonators acoustic resonators other advantage is that in principle they can be packed more densely than electrical filtration circuits acoustic wavelengths are much smaller than electromagnetic wavelengths weinstein says so for a given frequency my mechanical resonator is going to be much smaller but in practice the number of acoustic resonators in a filtration bank has been limited the heart of any device that converts electrical signals to mechanical vibrations or vice versa is a capacitor which can be thought of as two parallel metal plates separated by a small distance the capacitors change the impedance a measure of the ease with which a wave propagates that the antenna sees so you may have unwanted reflections back into the antenna weinstein says each capacitor from each filter is going to affect the antenna and that s no good it means i can only have so many filters and therefore so many frequencies that i can separate my signal into another problem with acoustic resonators is that turning them on or off a necessary step in the isolation of a particular transmission frequency requires giving each resonator its own electrical switch traditionally an incoming radio frequency signal has had to pass through that switch before reaching the resonator suffering some loss of quality in the process switching channels weinstein and popa solve both these problems at a stroke moreover they do it by adapting a technology already common in wireless devices a gallium nitride transistor almost all commercial transistors use semiconductors materials like gallium nitride that can be switched between a conductive and a nonconductive state by the application of a voltage in weinstein and popa s new resonator the lower plate of the capacitor is in fact a gallium nitride channel in its conductive state switching that channel to its nonconductive state is like removing the lower plate of the capacitor which drastically reduces the capacitors effect on the quality of the radio signal in experiments the mtl researchers found that their resonators had only one fourteenth the capacitive load of conventional resonators the radio can now afford to have times as many filters attached to the antenna weinstein says so we can span more frequencies switching the channel to its nonconductive state also turns the resonator off so the researchers new design requires no additional switch in the path of the incoming signal improving signal quality finally the new resonator uses only materials already found in the gallium arsenide transistors common in wireless devices so mass producing it should require no major modifications of existing manufacturing processes commercial adoption of cognitive radio has been slow for a number of reasons part of it is being able to get the frequency agile components and do it in a cost effective manner says thomas kazior a principal engineering fellow at raytheon plus the size constraint filters tend to be big to begin with

david karger have developed a way for users of crowdsourcing database operations to avoid computational details in the process while cost effectiveness is significantly improved the new system called qurk will automatically crowdsource tasks that are difficult or impossible to perform computationally read more in the august mit news office article by larry hardesty titled making crowdsourcing easier a new system for crowdsourcing database operations spares the user from worrying about the computational details but improves cost effectiveness also posted in its entirety below crowdsourcing is a technique for farming out labor intensive tasks over the internet by splitting them into small chunks that dozens hundreds or even thousands of people complete at their desks for a few cents each researchers at mit s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory are developing a new database system called qurk that will automatically crowdsource tasks that are difficult or impossible to perform computationally images stored in a standard database system for example could be sorted according to date of creation or some other data tag whether applied automatically or by hand images in a qurk database however could be sorted according to the approximate age of the people depicted or the appeal of the depicted locations as travel destinations or any other attribute whose assessment would require human judgment in a pair of conference papers last year the researchers described and demonstrated qurk s general computational framework in a new paper they re presenting this month at the th international conference on very large databases they get into the nitty gritty describing a series of experiments on how best to crowdsource the common database operations sort and join the researchers found that using the most obvious implementation of the join operation it cost to combine two sets of images through amazon s mechanical turk crowdsourcing service with an improved implementation that they arrived at experimentally they could get the cost down to when you write database queries in a declarative style using a language like sql says rob miller an associate professor of computer science and one of the authors of the qurk papers the database system can optimize them it can find the fastest way or the way that s cheapest in resources whatever those resources are to do it you didn t specify all the details about how it should be done the system figures all that out in the same way says adam marcus who leads qurk s development with fellow graduate student eugene wu qurk is intended to spare the user from specifying the details of how to crowdsource database operations you can just say i have this collection of images and i want to sort them by how cute they are and the system will actually figure out how to implement a sort over your data set marcus says crowdsourcing is particularly useful for tasks that are trivial for humans but difficult if not impossible for computers the paradigmatic such task is image recognition even the most complex time consuming image recognition algorithms can t identify objects in images nearly as consistently as people can so in their experiments the researchers concentrated on databases of images on all three qurk papers marcus wu and miller have been joined by professors sam madden and david karger both of the department of electrical engineering and computer science if you were going to use mechanical turk to sort images according to say how cute they were the most obvious approach would be to ask recruits turkers as they re generally known to compare two images at a time and rank them algorithms could then stitch the pairwise rankings into a master list one of the things the mit researchers were investigating was how many images a turker could be expected to rank at once and still provide useful data and their conclusion was somewhere between five and depending on the task they were also comparing ranking schemes with rating schemes in which turkers would assign each image a rating of one to five stars ratings systems which are favored by websites such as amazon and netflix have notorious drawbacks but the mit researchers developed an interface that depicted in addition to a large version of the image to be rated a row of smaller images randomly drawn from the database a turker rating his or her first image would thus have some sense of the average cuteness of the images in the database and could calibrate the ratings scale accordingly the researchers found that while ranking provided more accurate sorting the calibrated ratings system fared surprisingly well and was much cheaper depending on the sorting task the importance of perfect accuracy and the user s budget qurk could thus use ranking or rating or some hybrid of the two in which rating provided an initial ordering that the more expensive ranking then refined besides the sort operation the researchers also tested crowdsourced implementations of the join operation which merges data sets containing complementary information one data set for instance might contain entries that refer to companies by their names while the other refers to them by stock ticker symbols and the idea is to combine the records that refer to the same entities in the new experiments the turkers were joining data sets that contained some images of the same people or objects again the researchers found that turkers could accurately process images in small batches usually three or four pairs of images at a time the interface was designed so that a few images from each data set were displayed in columns the turker then had to draw a line connecting any two images of the
