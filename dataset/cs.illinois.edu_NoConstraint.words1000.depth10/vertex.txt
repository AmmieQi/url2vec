and co founder daphne koller delivered the robert mueller thuns lecture in computer science she spoke on the history of coursera and the impact that coursera and massive open online courses moocs have had in their short history daphne koller president and co founder of coursera gave the mueller thuns lecture in computer science she spoke on the development and impact that coursera and moocs in general have had coursera is the largest mooc provider with more than million registered learners worldwide koller leads the growth and nurturing of coursera s partnerships with over universities and educational institutions previously she was the rajeev motwani professor of computer science at stanford university where she served on the faculty for years coursera developed out of a pilot project at stanford in in which three graduate computer science courses on machine learning databases and artificial intelligence were put online for anyone to take for free with no advertising other than a mention in a new york times article these courses that typically had a total of stanford students enrolled suddenly had over enrolled online what was most striking was not the number but the diversity koller said these were people from every country every age group and every walk of life that exhibited this need to have access to a high quality education that many would never have had in any other way this eye opening experience led koller and some colleagues to form coursera to expand on this experience and to partner with other universities in order to open up educational opportunities to people around the world dr koller s talk drew a large crowd an overflow room with a live stream of the lecture was also filled koller described how moocs have changed over time the courses that are now on coursera were designed for an online environment not just versions of classroom courses put online course videos and other material can be reviewed as often as a learner wishes or needs over the course of a class in the online format you have option to pause reflect maybe ask questions on a discussion forum and get a chance to really get it before you move on koller said among the many students who have participated in their moocs koller related some stories of learners who have greatly benefited from their experiences including an individual for whom moocs provided a reentry point to college after years of employment and a group of women in india who used what they learned through coursera to run a successful bakery looking into the future of moocs koller sees them as having a transformative impact on graduate education specifically on professional graduate degrees if you have a family and a mortgage and a job you can t just pick up and go somewhere said koller instead programs like the new imba recently launched at illinois for the coursera platform could provide a way for these types of professionals to continue their education with minimal disruption to their lives the graduate education is becoming increasingly important koller said that s the big transformation that i think is very likely to happen the university of illinois and the department of computer science are both developing and providing moocs through coursera at the department level lawrence angrave was the first person to teach a mooc on developing android apps and the department has developed coursera specializations on cloud computing and data mining these specializations are targeted sequences of courses that end with a capstone project participants who complete these specializations receive a certificate to demonstrate their mastery of the subject material a video recording of dr koller s robert mueller thuns lecture is available online robert mueller thuns lecture in computer science the robert mueller thuns lecture in computer science was established at the university of illinois through memorial gifts by his wife nikki mueller thuns mirghafori bs family friends and colleagues robert thrived and made life long friends at illinois and it is hoped that the mueller thuns lectureship in computer science will give the chance to others at illinois to

association for computing machinery acm in the citation for this award warnow is recognized for contributions to mathematical theory algorithms and software for large scale molecular phylogenetics and historical linguistics she is one of acm members being recognized this year for their research contributions tandy warnow warnow a founder professor of engineering is an expert in the application of mathematics and computer science to developing algorithms for complex problems in the fields of phylogenomics the intersection of evolution and genomics metagenomics the study of genetic material in the environment and historical linguistics in both the biological and linguistics aspects of her research warnow studies ways to understand and estimate the evolution of a collection of genes species or languages from their common ancestor her more recent research work has focused on the biological side in this work warnow has been focusing on developing methods that can analyze large complex datasets and provide improved accuracy compared to existing methods and then collaborating with biologists in using those methods on biological datasets warnow has also contributed to mathematical theory in phylogenetics and was part of a team of researchers that developed the first absolute fast converging afc methods these methods have a theoretical guarantee of reconstructing the true evolutionary tree with high probability given polynomial length sequences similarly warnow has focused attention on the problem of performing large multiple sequence alignments in a reasonably efficient manner when she first started looking at the problem there were few methods available that could analyze large datasets and those that existed were not very accurate on large datasets in recent years warnow and her students developed not one but two approaches to producing accurate multiple sequence alignments of large datasets pasta and upp both approaches can work with datasets of up to million sequences while most projects may not need to be able to work with such large numbers of sequences some of the biological projects warnow participates in do require this kind of power the thousand plant transcriptome project has data sets that have more than sequences that need multiple alignment sequences warnow said so this was part of the motivation for us to develop these methods so it goes hand in hand with trying to analyze actual biological data one of the projects warnow works on is the avian phylogenomics project which was featured in a december special issue of science warnow was the computational leader for the phylogenetic analyses of this project which used the genomic sequences of bird species to develop a new understanding of the evolutionary family tree of birds one difficulty that warnow and her colleagues tackled in the avian project was finding a way to rigorously estimate the avian species tree using different genes within different species this work led to a new method called statistical binning which was published separately in the special issue of science warnow has also developed models and computational methods for the study of the evolution of languages languages also evolve like species and there are a lot of the same challenges for example just as there is horizontal gene transfer in biology languages have loan words and so also have this kind of horizontal transfer warnow said warnow began working on indo european languages trying to determine how that large family of languages which includes english evolved and what the evolutionary tree of this large family of languages may look like basically we were trying to characterize the properties of how different features of languages evolve she said using that structure that we developed we came up with methods to estimate evolution of indo european and other families using this model the work they did was influential in the historical linguistics community the work was featured in the top journals in that field and has a lasting impact on the understanding of the development of those languages it stood the test of time in that linguists accept our estimations as opposed to those that people posited based on other types of analyses warnow said and this work was published in the top journals in the linguistics field and it has had lasting impact it s been so busy with biology and my students have been wanting to primarily work on the biology side but i m still planning to get back on the linguistics side i m still involved in that community warnow said acm will formally recognize the fellows at the acm awards banquet which is scheduled for saturday june in san francisco california among the many other recognitions warnow has received for her research achievements are an nsf national young investigator award in a david and lucile packard foundation fellowship in a radcliffe institute for advance study fellowship in and a john simon

staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news angrave completes teaching first mooc on developing android apps by tom moone cs illinois fri no matter how experienced a teacher you are launching a course with over registrants has to be a daunting task cs professor lawrence angrave recently had the very feeling as he completed teaching the first mooc on developing apps for the android platform lawrence angrave well if it was intimidating at the beginning you wouldn t know it by looking at angrave several weeks into the course he still looked buoyant and excited about it once of the aspects of a mooc that angrave noticed quickly is how it can cause the instructor to become somewhat schizophrenic at any one time he is thinking of the current week that the online students are working on as well as the upcoming week that needs to be finalized and the week in the future for which he is currently recording the material you have to have this split brain angrave said people ask how is it going and i have to say well which week are you talking about vibrant online community one of the aspects that angrave was pleased to see develop was an active online community among the students in the course the forums became a place for students to solve unusual situations that they have come across some students in particular situations discovered unique problems with some of the software through the forums they found solutions students have been able to come up with fixes to a variety of bizarre situations said angrave with video production for the mooc course stretching over the winter break angrave recorded some lessons from his vacation in guatemala even more impressive were the personal connections that students made through the online forums and students discovered they were not alone in finding an assignment challenging in addition there were connections made on the newsgroups among people who had similar backgrounds but who lived in geographically different places said angrave it was a very human element to this very technical course course with impact i get a lot of satisfaction out of realizing that so many people are excited about this content said angrave several of angrave s lessons brought in the history of the computer science discipline such as this visit to the spurlock museum to look at items related to john bardeen co inventor of the transistor but though the content did have impact on the students the extent of that impact was up to each participant for some students just watching the videos available online will be as far as they want to go with the course others will be more fully engaged with completing assignments and interacting with other students i don t see that as a problem said angrave i think that is one of the great benefits of moocs you have structured introductory material in a way that is accessible to people given a certain amount of time moocs have been a great leveler the impact of the course on the students can be seen in some of their comments on the forums said one student since i started this course i have been dreaming nothing but scrambled java code and i wake up saying things like linear layout and scroll view to myself this goes on all night every night is it just me keeping it interesting keeping it real angrave worked to keep the students interested and where possible entertained during the class one particular approach was what he called a fun video that they did at the end of the week for two of those videos illinois undergraduates with some android programming experience talked to the course participants angrave said that these undergraduate students could speak to how difficult they found android programming at the beginning but that persistence would pay lawrence angrave prepares to sing modern code in general which he wrote to introduce the java language to his mooc course one end of the week video was recorded in the spurlock museum there angrave showed the nobel prize won by illinois faculty member john bardeen who received the award as part of the team that invented the transistor we were able to look at it as the grandfather of our computers and cell phones and the blue waters facility angrave said it was nice to place android development with the broader context of computer science to introduce the java language which has only words angrave decided to go beyond simply giving a list of the words instead he put the words to music and created a music video personal evaluation looking back over the past several weeks of this mooc i ve very happy with how the course has turned out said angrave for a first offering for my first time i give myself a good eight maybe nine you can always see better ways to do things but for that particular point in time i think we did a pretty good job we made a course that was as accessible as possible angrave was quick to point out that the course came together only with the assistance of others creating the course was an extraordinary amount of work explained angrave this course is the product of many talented and dedicated people from illinois including jason mock liam moran colleen cook katherine woodruff and angie mock representing groups from atlas and citl my graduate and undergraduate computer science assistants were rohan arora will hennessy vishal disawar vishnu indukuri and nelson osacky everyone worked very hard to create and then run

administrator of nasa charles bolden to the aeronautics committee of the nasa advisory council he will serve on this committee from to as a member of nasa advisory council he will advise the administrator bolden on nasa s research programs lui sha sha the donald b gillies chair in computer science at illinois was selected for this council based largely on the body of work he has accomplished in the area of safety critical real time systems his work enabled the development of the real time computing system for the international space station the former nasa deputy administrator aaron cohen remarked in october we now have a system that will allow space station freedom s computers to budget their time to choose between a variety of tasks and decide not only which one to do first but how much time to spend in the process sha s work on real time computing has transformed ieee standards on real time computing has become the best practice of the real time computing industry and is regularly taught in real time computing classes his work made it possible to upgrade software in orbiting satellites an advance that is critical for the success and safety of gps based navigation systems without lui s system in place such upgrades would be much more difficult if not impossible his work also saved an interplanetary mission in the mars pathfinder mission reached mars and the sojourner rover landed on the planet after a few days of sending back information to earth the system started repeatedly resetting and unable to continue the mission research by sha was used to correct problems with the sojourner rover on mars these software problems were discovered to be the result of priority inversion meaning that high priority tasks are pathologically blocked by low priority tasks it was a widespread problem embedded in operating systems languages and computer buses research done by sha on this problem was used to correct the flaw in the rover making it reliable once more currently the federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency do not allow the use of more than one core in a multicore chip because of serious intercore interference problems in current muticore chips sha has been leading the effort called single core equivalent technology to address this challenge with graduate students and with cs professor marco caccamo professor rodolfo pellizzoni of university of waterloo professor heechul yun of kanas both were phd students of marco and sha and senior engineers from lockheed martin and rockwell collins the rapid success of this new technology has enabled sha to work with industry and with faa s chief scientist for software certification to develop the certification requirements for multicore avionics work by sha may improve cyber physical systems in an emergency room environments sha s research has also had applications in the health industry current work in conjunction with dr richard berlin and icu physicians at carle hospital is examining cyber physical systems in an emergency room environment together with graduate students and postdocs they developed the cardiac arrest resuscitation best practice guidance system which has been evaluated by six carle physicians recently they unanimously recommend to carle administration to move it to clinical trial in addition this team has started working on best practice guidance system for sepsis and stroke across carle hospital network uiuc and carle have jointly filing a patent for the underlying technology computational pathophysiology sha s service on the nasa advisory council will assist the launch of a new approach for research projects underwritten by the agency nasa s new strategy will be to let universities help formulate the key research issues said sha in the past nasa said i m going to do this and they would write a call for proposals now the thinking is that this is not the best way to utilize the talents of the universities so they would like to the universities have more say given nasa s goals of what is the best research that a university can submit over the course of his career sha has also served as a member of the office of the secretary of defense s avionics advisory team the national academy of science s committee on certifiably dependable software the peer review panel of safety critical avionics systems branch at nasa s langley research center and the nsf s planning committee on cyber physical systems on high assurance medical devices sha was a recipient of the david

prospective students current students courses alumni research news department news e newsletter click magazine featured lectures videos corporate partners about us faculty positions staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news new method helps map species genetic heritage by liz ahlberg u of i news bureau thu where did the songbird get its song what branch of the bird family tree is closer to the flamingo the heron or the sparrow these questions seem simple but are actually difficult for geneticists to answer a new sophisticated statistical technique developed by researchers at the university of illinois and the university of texas at austin can help researchers construct more accurate species trees detailing the lineage of genes and the relationships between species tandy warnow developed a new statistical method that sorts genetic data to construct better species trees detailing genetic lineage the method called statistical binning was used in the avian phylogenetics project the subject of a december special issue of the journal science a species tree is a way of describing how a species evolved from a common ancestor said study leader and founder professor of bioengineering and computer science tandy warnow researchers use a species tree to do all sorts of things like figure out when different traits came into being and what triggered that trait evolution and how those things may or may not have been triggered by environmental changes there are two main approaches to constructing a species tree from genomic data warnow said one method which has prevailed for decades puts all the gene data together into one giant matrix and analyzes it to map the overall species tree this is called concatenation the difficulty with that approach is that individual genes often have different lineages which can diverge greatly from each other and the species tree as a whole a second approach the coalescent based method looks at the data for each gene and estimates gene trees for each trait then it combines all the trees together to create the overall species tree while this approach is sound theoretically and statistically it does not perform as well as expected in practice we realized that the gene trees that are combined have error in them warnow said when the gene trees have error then when you combine them you get a bad estimate of the species tree so we needed to get better gene trees and the question is how do we do that statistical binning takes all the gene data and uses statistical optimization techniques to sort the genes into sets or bins the genes in each bin have trees that don t seem to have statistically significant differences the data for each bin is combined into a supergene tree and then the supergene trees are combined into an overall species tree you can think of statistical binning as combining the best properties of the two dominant approaches said siavash mirarab graduate student at the university of texas at austin and first author of the paper detailing the statistical binning method without this method what people had to do was throw away data they didn t like this approach allows you to use all the data you have and you don t have to throw away anything we have a method that achieves that by grouping things together in a way that makes sense statistically the researchers compared the species trees produced using the coalescent method with statistical binning to trees produced with concatenation or coalescence alone for several biological classes such as birds mammals yeast and others they found that adding the statistical binning process to the pipeline produced species trees that were better than the trees produced by either of the conventional methods researchers have worked out the evolutionary relationships of dozens of bird species the findings add to the evidence that some traits such as vocal learning or foot propelled underwater diving evolved independently among different groups of birds graphic by julie mcmahon we sort the gene data in a sophisticated statistical way but having done it we get better trees warnow said the result is significantly improved estimates of the gene trees which gave us better estimates of the species tree and branch lengths which helps you figure out when things happened everything was much more accurate statistical binning allowed the avian phylogenetics project to analyze more than genes one of the largest such projects yet published and construct a large tree linking many different bird species read more about the results warnow and mirarab plan to continue to refine the statistical binning method and hope that it can add accuracy to many other similar studies there s a large divide in the research community as to whether to use concatenation of a coalescent analyses what we did was understand why the coalescent method didn t give good results and came up with a way of improving the input so that it could have good results it s a way of bringing these two very divided communities into greater agreement with each other warnow said the national

who have passed the qualifying exam in spring or later however it is highly recommended for all students the outside member cannot have been a student of the current thesis advisor within the last five years and must have independent publications that occurred after earning their ph d degree in addition if the outside member is a post doc he she can serve as a non voting member only if there are more than members on a committee the majority vote needs to favor the cs department faculty if you are unsure please contact mary beth kelley at mkelley at illinois dot edu note the outside member must have a ph d and does not need to be a university faculty member for example this member could belong to an industrial or government research lab if necessary teleconferencing technology may be used for the prelim exam for approval of the outside member the department of computer science and the graduate college require their cv and a brief statement of why they were chosen the five requirements above are also imposed on the ph d committee for the final exam although the committees may be different advice on how to form the committee it is good for students to involve additional researchers in their efforts as early as possible remember students are not locked into particular committee choices until their preliminary exam in some sense the ph d committee is just a formal mechanism to stimulate interaction between faculty and students it is generally recommended that a student have at least one committee member who is not a specialist in the general area of research pursued in the thesis the ability to explain and justify research to outsiders is crucial to the success of a researcher it is fairly common to have more committee members than the minimum of four this helps to further enhance the quality and visibility of the work furthermore it may be easier to satisfy the five requirements on ph d committees by having more members department of computer

current students graduate students ph d students ph d prelim exam thesis proposal ph d prelim exam thesis proposal in the semester that qualifying exam is passed students are expected to form a ph d committee in addition students should have a prelim committee in place prior to writing their proposal and scheduling the prelim exam to learn more about the guidelines and process of forming a ph d committee visit ph d committee section purpose writing a good proposal is an important part of being a successful researcher the thesis proposal preliminary exam is viewed as an important milestone that helps students develop this skill the ph d student writes a proposal that is submitted to the ph d committee prior to the exam the thesis proposal presentation gives the ph d committee a formal opportunity to evaluate the research progress and goals of the student thus the two main purposes of the preliminary exam are to develop proposal writing skills and to obtain feedback on the research plan from the ph d committee exam policies the thesis proposal presentation preliminary exam should be held within a year or two of passing the qualifying exam it may be taken no later than five semesters after passing the qualifying exam effective fall term all students must now be registered for the term in which the prelim exam occurs all ph d candidates whose native language is not english regardless of us citizenship must pass the tse passing score is the speak passing score is the toefl ibt speaking subsection passing scores is the ielts speaking subsection passing score is or the epi exam passing score is administered by the university prior to attempting the preliminary exam for students who have entered the program fall and foward must complete this requirement before attempting the qualifying exam the thesis proposal must be submitted to the ph d committee at least three weeks prior to the exam this gives the committee sufficient time to carefully read the proposal and evaluate the ideas failure to submit the proposal on time may result in having to reschedule the exam the ph d committee for the exam must satisfy the five criteria given in the ph d committee section the proposed committee and exam date must be submitted to the academic officeat least weeks prior to the exam by completing the prelim final exam form the graduate college requires this time to approve the committee and officially appoint it effective fall the graduate college will require an original wet signatures of the chair co chair and department head on the prelim exam result form contact mkelley at illinois dot edu mary beth kelly or at in the academic office with any questions guidance on how to write the proposal a balance must be struck between satisfying severe space limitations and providing the most critical details the proposal is not a binding agreement between the student and the ph d committee on the precise tasks that must be accomplished through frequent interactions with ph d committee members the student can adapt the specific thesis accomplishments as necessary the thesis proposal should be between and pages when single spaced format bibliographic references are not included in this page count having more references is encouraged there are no explicit page limits or formatting requirements if proposals are much shorter or longer than the norm the ph d committee will question the reasons for this if the proposal is much too long the committee may recommend rescheduling the exam after the proposal is rewritten three main criteria are usually applied in evaluating a proposal the first two are similar to the national science foundation s guidelines for evaluating research proposals intellectual merit what is the importance of the activity to advancing knowledge or understanding expected impact what impact can be expected in terms of particular research communities and on society in general feasibility how likely are the stated goals to be achieved by the candidate based on these criteria the thesis proposal should contain an overview of the state of the art which helps to show that the candidate has a good grasp of the relevant research fields a brief summary of research results obtained so far by the candidate this includes citing prior publications and current submissions produced by the student a clear description of the remaining problems and goals some details of the proposed technical approach clear arguments as to why the work is interesting in terms of intellectual merit and expected impact an explanation of how the goals can be accomplished within the expected amount of time the thesis proposal should not be a preliminary draft of the thesis particular chapters or parts of the

positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store current students home current students undergraduates how advising works in the computer science department how advising works in the computer science department the computer science department has a three tiered approach to advising the academic office faculty mentors and peer advisors below is a breakdown of what you should and should not expect from each source of advising the academic officein general to help students navigate their degree requirements and the policies of their department their college and the university as a whole the academic office staff professor lenny pitt director of undergraduate programs steve herzog full time advisor heather zike full time advisor holly bagwell course scheduler and office manager and candy foster office support specialist can do the following for you review your degree requirements and assess your progress note you can find program requirements and a requirements flowcharts for all of our programs on the departmental wiki help you plan your course schedule explain the policies and procedures of your department college and university refer you to someone who can help if you are struggling academically or otherwise advise on transferring in or out of the department assess transfer coursework computer science coursework only though make curriculum adjustments e g declaring changing your technical track for international students process i extension optional practical training opt or curricular practical training cpt paperwork you should not expect the academic office staff to do the following help you with questions about the content of your classes get you into classes though in certain cases they can provide overrides or point you in the right direction get you out of classes though they can advise you on the ramifications of and procedures for dropping classes faculty mentorsall students are assigned a faculty mentor with whom they must meet at least once each academic year typically before april the department enforces this requirement with a registration hold you can find your faculty mentor and schedule appointments with him or her on my cs illinois edu faculty mentors can be a central contact point and liaison between you and the faculty help you map out the field of computer science and explain its various areas of specialization based on your strengths and interests help you sort out which area of computer science you might specialize in suggest courses to take based on your interests provide information about possible career paths provide information on research opportunities provide information on graduate school provide a letter of recommendation if you get to know a faculty member well enough and demonstrate strong ability in their courses that is you should not necessarily expect faculty mentors to help you with the following answer detailed or complicated questions about degree requirements or university policies these should be forwarded to the undergraduate advisors in the academic office select social science and humanities electives tell you which courses are easier than others ask peer advisors or other students determine how transfer and ap courses count towards graduation requirements instructions for this are posted on the policies and procedures page of the cs website add or drop a class for students instructions for this are posted on the policies and procedures page of the cs website get students out of academic troubles students who are struggling should contact the undergraduate advisors in the academic office as soon as possible for options and advice in addition to meeting with your faculty mentor you should feel free to meet with other faculty such as those with whom you ve had classes you ve enjoyed or those from a research area that is of interest to you you can arrange a meeting or stop by during office hours on the cs website you can find a list of cs faculty members arranged alphabetically or by research specialty with links to each faculty member s website and contact info your peers especially advanced students the best source of inside information on what to expect from individual classes and instructors your peers can do the following for you help you anticipate the work load and difficulty of each course help you anticipate the individual teaching styles of various instructors give you survival tips for each course recommend specific courses to take for electives and or gen eds though you should always confirm that their recommendations actually satisfy the requirements in question remember that your peers have widely varying degrees of experience so what one student might find relatively easy could be very difficult for another so seek multiple opinions and gauge whether your own level experience matches that of the person you are asking you should not expect your peers to help you with the following answer detailed or complicated questions about degree requirements or university policies these should be forwarded to the undergraduate advisors in the academic office suggest exceptions or alternatives to requirements or policies you should view all such information with skepticism and confirm it with the academic office undergraduate advising cs academic office siebel center phone

students register for summer and fall classes starting the previous april here are some answers to frequently asked questions and information about registration and advising timeframe q when does registration begin a to see how registration times are determined check this page on the office of the registrar s website q that s great but when do i get to register a you should receive an email about this from the office of the registrar around the middle of each spring and fall term which reminds me read your email following the instructions in the email you ll be able to look for your time ticket earliest registration time on enterprise student self service once the time stated on your time ticket comes up you can start registering for your courses q what happens if i wait until later a few weeks or months after my time ticket to register it s not a big deal is it a only if you actually want to get into the classes that you need we ve noticed that some important cs courses have been filling up the last few semesters so we re trying to help you by restricting registration in many of our core courses cs cs cs cs cs cs cs cs cs many level electives to certain majors and in the case of cs to seniors at least until all seniors have had a chance to register we lift those restrictions from most of those courses the monday after early registration ends so if you haven t registered by then and find that you can t get into the class you need we re not going to be too sympathetic putting together your schedule take note of recent changes see the last q a above about the restrictions we re placing on registration and the need to register as soon as you can after your earliest registration time comes up as most of you already know cs and cs have been eliminated and the material from these courses condensed into a single computer architecture course cs computer architecture students who have credit for both cs and cs should not take the new course any student who has completed cs but not cs must take the new course information about requirements q how can i figure out which courses i should register for next semester a here are some basic guidelines for putting together your schedule check the requirements flowcharts and course planning forms for your major they can be found on the cs undergraduate programs wiki here you can also follow your progress by checking your degree audit you can access your degree audit on the web based dars system the registrar s office has a convenient link to the dars portal q my dars looks incomplete what can i do about it a for most core requirements and general education requirements dars is accurate but it has not caught up with some items the new algorithms and models of comp course cs offered currently as a cs speical topics course for example and the new cs track requirements for cs engineering students we re working with the various colleges to get these fixed in the meantime you can use the revised requirements flowcharts and course planning forms if your situation is not so straightforward or if you re really struggling in your courses this fall you should talk to undergrad at cs dot illinois dot edu the cs undergrad advisors before you register for your courses caution when drawing up your schedule pay close attention to course offering patterns do not overload yourself some courses are offered fall only or spring only so if you re within or fewer semesters of graduating plan out the rest of your courses carefully so you don t wind up needing a course that isn t offered the semester you intend to graduate we anticipate this might be a problem particularly for cs in engineering majors who plan on completing the two course software engineering or senior project sequence and or certain specializations this also applies to math cs and stats cs majors looking to complete certain required courses at the junior and senior levels be careful not to overload yourself if you re struggling that might be a sign that you need to take fewer hours or fewer technical hours if you re wondering if your proposed course schedule is manageable ask other cs students and don t be afraid to get more than one opinion information about individual courses if you want information about individual courses here are critical sources of information that students often overlook the university academic catalog with links to the course catalog which lists every single course each department offers the degree programs index and more the university course explorer which lists all courses offered for a specific term lists courses that satisfy different categories of general education requirements and more some cs courses have websites accessible here be sure to check out new courses and special topics courses see below remember free electives if you complete only the specific requirements for your major and your general education requirement you probably will not be eligible to

as the course description states a student works with a faculty member on a mutually agreed upon thesis topic and completes a written thesis work involves literature search oral presentation analysis and or implementation paper preparation and a written thesis who can do a senior thesis who must do a thesis who should do a senior thesis any undergraduate major in the computer science department cs in engineering math cs in las stats cs in las can complete a senior thesis a thesis is required for students completing the computational science and engineering cse technical track or mathematics technical track in the bs in cs engineering curriculum some students in the james scholars program are also required as part of their honors contract to complete a senior thesis a thesis is recommended for any student with a strong interest in graduate work because completing a thesis provides valuable experience in undertaking individual research formulating questions conducting research and writing up conclusions students completing the cs track may complete the senior thesis as an alternative to the software engineering or senior project sequences when should i get started when is it due don t count on completing a senior thesis from topic formulation to finished product in the space of a single semester you should already have your topic formulated by the early registration period for the semester in which you plan to begin your thesis and you should begin your thesis the semester before you graduate instructors can submit dfr deferred grades if the thesis isn t finished by the end of the term and if the thesis advisor thinks it appropriate if you take two full semesters to complete the thesis which we ve found is quite common you may sign up for cs for hours for each semester in which you work on the project how do i register for a senior thesis first come up with topic and find an advisor see below for suggestions on how to do this once you have a rough idea of the topic fill out and print out the undergrad thesis form accessible at the following link https cs illinois edu sites default files docs ugthesis pdf get your advisor s signature on the form and bring the signed form to the academic office siebelcenter where you ll receive the crn for the section you should register for how do i come up with a topic some students have definite and fairly detailed ideas for their thesis if this is you shop for an advisor willing to supervise your work selecting from faculty whose research areas match your intended thesis if this is not you then you should start by first deciding on the sub area of cs in which you d like to do a thesis think back on which cs courses you ve found particularly interesting and or which cs courses you ve done particularly well in was there a topic that you found especially intriguing is there an application of computer science that you want to investigate once you know the general area you should contact a faculty member whose research is in that area and get help coming up with a specific topic that matches your general interests how do i find a thesis advisor again you should think of a course or an area of cs that you ve found interesting motivating etc you can contact the instructor for the course you particularly enjoyed or you can look up the other faculty in the area that interests you by consulting the directory of faculty by research area on the cs website http www cs uiuc edu directory faculty by research php you should also check the faculty research page on the wiki where faculty list opportunities for undergraduates to get involved with ongoing research and give brief descriptions of the kinds of research they are currently conducting many of the faculty members listed on this page specify cs as among the research opportunities they offer how long does it have to be your faculty member will help make sure your thesis is considerable enough without being overwhelming can i have a thesis advisor from another department it is possible to complete a thesis under the guidance of a faculty member from another department the thesis has to be cs related however and you have to have a cs faculty member agree to serve as the advisor in name if not in practice the cs faculty member must assign the final grade even if he she simply accepts from the actual thesis advisor from another department ideally the cs faculty member should work together with the in practice advisor is there a list of past senior thesis topics not yet but we re working on it are there formatting and submission guidelines do i have to defend my thesis and or deposit it anywhere unlike a masters or phd thesis which must adhere strictly to university wide formatting and submission guidelines an undergraduate senior thesis can follow a format set by the thesis advisor once the thesis advisor is satisfied with the final product and assigns a grade that s it

insights tom moone cs illinois fri on november scott fisher ms cs returned to cs illinois as an engineer in residence eir to teach students a bit of the history of the computing industry and to share advice for achieving success in the computing field engineer in residence scott fisher showed current cs illinois students how computers used to be programmed with computer punch cards as fisher pointed out the university of illinois has been a leader in the computing science field for more than years a display on the first floor of siebel center features information on ordvac and illiac i two essentially identical computers that were designed and built on the university campus of particular significance to fisher was the innovation in computing that ordvac which as built for the u s army represented it was the first computer ever that was built taken apart put on a truck sent somewhere washington d c put back together and still worked fisher explained that was amazing the illiac computers went through four generations and fisher remembered the illiac iv from his time as a student fisher showed off a computer punch card that he had used when he was a student in the department he explained how each line of code was contained on a separate card once a collection of cards that represented a program had been completed they were fed into the computer to run the program one of the downsides is that if you make a typing mistake now it is wrong and there is no erase key so you have to redo it so you typed slow to make sure it was right fisher said we also had one of the early and classic timesharing computes the decsystem one of the uses was to create a card deck as a file and have it processed in champaign or at chicago circle and there were other dangers with the card deck as well if you drop them that s really bad fisher said my thesis was tens of thousands of cards what we used to do if you had a lot of cards was to draw a diagonal line across the top with a magic marker if you dropped the cards you could align the cards and get it within a few cards and then you could look at it by hand fisher said that the important part of the story is not just how things have changed over the past years but how they have remained the same in principle current computers while unimaginably more powerful still follow the principles outlined by john von neumann in fisher also had other show and tell items that he described to the students including a dectape a magnetic storage medium developed by digital equipment corporation in the s at the time these tapes were relatively expensive but it was a sure way to save programs this tape is astonishing most tapes are a linear set of records this is actually block structured it has a master file directory in the middle of the tape so you add and delete files on the tape and this ran really fast in both directions fisher said of the tape he demonstrated at his talk fisher said my master s is on here because i always had a backup but of course i can t read it because we don t have any machines left that can read it fisher also showed off a sample of magnetic core memory from one of the first computers he worked on this was about years ago and it was kb and it was state of the art he said fisher also showed how large magnetic core memory used to be in the computers he first learned to work with fisher then described how he took the education he gained at illinois and launched his own career he worked for a number of leading technology companies such as digital equipment corporation philips nv remmele engineering and minco since he has been with ecolab a global leader in water hygiene and energy technologies and services at ecolab he manages the it group supporting the company s largest sales division his team develops software to collect data from industrial controllers the internet of things and manages chemistry and regulatory data here s a company that does chemistry and service fisher said but it also got a group that knows how to interface hardware fisher said that he believes he has been successful as a manager at ecolab because he tries to develop and maintain an atmosphere where fun and serious work coincide have been a key to his team s success some of his parting advice for the students was for them to look for that kind of atmosphere in any future employment when you go out to find a job find out the chemistry of the department he said what s it like is it a group that gets along quite well and helps each other and wants to win cs illinois

volunteers the high school students received an introduction to technology and the culture of cs illinois chictech provides an opportunity for high school girls to learn more about computers and coding cs illinois junior brianna ifft was the director and primary organizer for this year s event she and her team of volunteers and assistants worked together to give the attendees a valuable and inspiring weekend the attendees arrived starting at on the saturday morning and left sunday afternoon at p m there were three workshops held over the course of the weekend on scratch html and javascript depending on the participant s experience they let me know when they registered how much experience they had and i placed them in those accordingly said ifft in addition to the technically focused workshops there were several other activities designed to get the attendees to work together get to know one another and see more of the illinois campus they had a scavenger hunt throughout the north part of campus teams of students posted photos of themselves at many each of the goals they were trying to achieve in checking off their list there was also a movie that they all watched and a session of cs trivia teams gave presentations on the projects they completed during the weekend students had a great time as indicated by their feedback some said it was life changing ifft said they really liked meeting girls who were like minded as them or who were pursuing similar goals in the post event evaluations one participant said everything was great it is a really good opportunity for girls who are interested in cs and those who are still trying to figure out what they want to study so keep it up and definitely something that should be done every year congratulations for your effort time and creativity it was a great retreat something i would do again without a doubt another said thank you girls so much for this amazing experience i had so much fun and learned a lot too i will definitely give my current cs teacher positive reviews and we ll recommend this for next year s girls i appreciate the time and effort taken to put this together and i feel empowered and not as scared to major in cs in addition several attendees indicated that their high schools didn t offer any computer science classes or any clubs to help teach computer skills for them it was really eye opening said ifft so it really opened them up to what computer science is the success of the event is due in large part to the effort ifft put into it scheduling for the event was already under way by the end of the spring semester over the course of the summer ifft developed a budget and contacted companies to provide sponsorship and swag for attendees in the fall she started looking for volunteers and worked on the finer details of the event this year chictech included participants and over volunteers the event was run as a partnership between the cs department and wcs with the department underwriting the cost of the event cj coleman cs illinois associate director of external relations said cs illinois and wcs have been honored to run our chictech programs including the chictech retreat for over ten years now the department is committed to supporting outreach programs to introduce cs concepts to women and underrepresented populations of all ages we look forward to keeping in touch with our attendees to help foster their interests in cs and ifft is an example of how chictech can help foster these interests ifft was a particularly strong advocate for this year s chictech because she had been a participant when she was in high school that experience was really impactful for me ifft said it helped me decide where i wanted to go to college and i got to meet all the wcs girls i felt that i already had a community when i came here it is quite likely that some attendees from this year s event will look back on chictech with similar feelings media contacts media

earned the award for her creative teaching methodologies positive impact on students development of innovative courses and work in community outreach the cs illinois community should realize how lucky they and their students are to have someone as talented and dedicated as cinda as part of their team polito said but i suspect that they already know that heeren currently teaches cs data structures and programming principles a challenging course that all cs and computer engineering majors must take at the start of this semester nearly students were enrolled heeren said but about of them dropped the class during the first few weeks thanks to heeren s initiative those students don t have to give up on their computer science aspirations instead they are invited to take an evening remedial class to prepare them properly so they can retake the course the following semester i feel like if they have to drop the course because they re not thriving this is too big of a hit to take when you re a sophomore she said the remedial class gives them a smaller community of people that are like them and that s ok it s nice to provide students with that level of attention at such a crisis point for them in the spring semester heeren and cs teaching assistant professor wade fagen piloted a new course cs data driven discovery where the students learn to collect various types of data images text numeric geographic or integrated analyze the data and then produce a visualization to illustrate what they learned from the data nineteen students all of whom are majoring in something other than cs currently take this course this cs was the first course that made me feel confident in using coding to do research said tim krock a junior economics major who created a national language toolkit data visualization that identified the characters of a book and plotted their paths through the story it brought me out of my shell as a programmer i was able to go do some very cool projects largely due to the guidance offered in this class commenting on heeren s teaching style krock added she often makes class feel as much like a conversation as a lecture she can crack jokes without breaking the

poloney attended has experienced the highs and lows of creating successful software products and building two startup companies poloney a cs illinois distinguished achievement award shared his entrepreneurial journey with students on october as an engineer in residence in the cs department joel poloney returned to illinois to share his insights on startups with cs illinois students a gifted software developer poloney and three illinois classmates sizhao zao yang amitt mahajan and luke rajlich started myminilife inc in in champaign while poloney was still a student originally i wasn t looking to start a company but it sort of morphed into that poloney said i just wanted to build stuff and see what we could do the company s product also called myminilife was a virtual world and social networking application that allowed users to express themselves by generating characters creating and customizing virtual spaces and goods and visiting and interacting with other users creations the game s popularity soared after a favorable review from techcrunch in august poloney took a leave of absence from school to move with the company to palo alto where he and his co founders spent six months raising from two investors however this amount was not enough to sustain the company by early we were running out of money and our investors were running out of patience with us he recalled by june poloney and his colleagues sold myminilife to social networking game maker zynga and they moved to san francisco where they quickly developed and released farmville the wildly popular facebook game within seven months of its release farmville had million users worldwide poloney left zynga in late and founded red hot labs with mahajan we wanted to do a technology refresh said poloney we had a vague vision of building something for mobile but we didn t know exactly what space at first he and mahajan developed various mobile games but it was the internal analytics tools they created to help shed light on players usage patterns that seemed strongest seeing the value of these tools red hot labs pivoted from games to mobile analytics as a company this was huge because we were pivoting away from a consumer based business to a b b service based saas business poloney said we had to reset the company which was really really difficult they renamed the company after its leading product toro which helped developers promote their mobile apps on facebook by automatically creating and testing hundreds of variants for each ad campaign in february google purchased the company and poloney was on the move again this time to mountain view where he became a tech lead on google s admob app monetization analysis and promotion platform poloney gave an in depth look at how startups develop and change over time poloney described four important lessons he learned through his entrepreneurial journey first networking is key to fundraising even though they had an interesting fun product poloney said with our first company we had zero contacts it took six months to raise just it was a brutal process a slog with red hot labs poloney noted they had a vague vision no product but they had contacts and friends who could potentially be investors within two months they raised million they could do this poloney said because they had built creditability they networked they promoted their work and they created products that provided value a second lesson for entrepreneurs is the importance of hiring it s hard said poloney who recalled spending a lot of mornings during the time of red hot labs interviewing prospective employees it takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money and then people leave especially in california poloney advised his cs student audience to be patient with the process look for candidates within their circle of friends and acquaintances definitely consider hiring fellow illinois classmates and sell prospective employees on their company vision rather than on a specific product the third lesson was that change is good and it s ok to shift a company s product focus there s a magical art to pivoting your company there s really no right or wrong way to do this he said try not to get too emotionally invested in one particular product think about the greater vision the fourth point poloney made was that exiting or selling a company is not about the money it s about taking your product and vision to the next level moving on and doing something greater than you could have done by yourself he said poloney also encouraged students to work on side projects while in school outside of coursework because developing a pattern of hard work is great preparation for success in the real world all that starts way early and carries with you for the rest of your career said poloney who wrote visualization software at ncsa helped develop a campus navigation app and developed siebel center s first touch panel directory while he was a student cs illinois engineer in residence eir program as an engineer in residence eir alumni reside in the department for a day or more to help students develop their computer science education into

valentine ece illinois thu at a classroom a few blocks away from new york s battery park a cohort of aspiring programmers are hard at work tossing around ideas hacking together projects and building their software development skills from the ground up david yang this is fullstack academy an immersive software engineering school founded by illinois alumni and software professionals david yang bsee and nimit maru bs cs yang and maru met as freshmen at illinois at an election meeting for engineering freshman committee and rapidly became best friends through the course of their college career i didn t know anyone and sat down after my speech and david tapped me on the shoulder and asked what operating system do you run maru said i sat there and instantly thought this kid really gets me and we ve been best friends since nimit maru after graduating and spending a few years on career tracks in software engineering and entrepreneurship both decided to quit their current positions and started teaching a series of coding workshops at mba programs and colleges across the nation realizing their passion for teaching the two went through a rigorous entrepreneurship training process through seed fund provider y combinator and came out with the idea and funds for fullstack academy which they founded in at fullstack s campus in new york yang and maru try to recreate a bustling college atmosphere students from all age ranges and careers typically ranging anywhere from fresh college graduates to middle aged career transitioners take three months off to stay in new york and dedicate time and effort to intensively mastering software development maru noted that the student body at fullstack comes from more than different countries from hong kong to moscow fullstack boasts a percent employment rate for its alumni and students from the boot camp have gone on to work at companies like dropbox accenture and visa and some have formed their own startups like unightlife io yang and maru grew up in the midwest and worked in places as diverse as philadelphia and the bay area and they settled on new york as the location for their academy at first the choice seems odd as conventionally silicon valley is popularized as the nation s hotbed of digital innovation we ve both worked in the valley but there s something magical about new york yang said it s the most frenetic place in the world there s so much energy here especially in the tech ecosystem new york is becoming the next silicon valley and tech seems much more applied here there are rapidly growing industries in technology for finance e commerce and fashion every industry is being reimagined here fullstack s overall philosophy of education is to make students comfortable developing for the entire range of low to high level web development the literal full stack of development areas from base levels of data manipulation to high levels of design this is also why the academy chooses to teach its students javascript while many other boot camps provide a grounding in ruby on rails fullstack argues that javascript is the only language that is used at every layer in the stack of web development yang and maru have implemented a project oriented approach to learning at fullstack and students have responded with a variety of projects that apply the coding skills they ve learned to areas that inspire them these areas could range from the whimsical to the real world and some of fullstack s students even tie their newfound coding knowledge in with social justice issues students collaborating on a project at fullstack academy for example students seema ullal and sarah muenzinger created an algorithm called the bechdelator which analyzes movie scripts through the famous bechdel test for their representations of female characters this test created by feminist artist and writer alison bechdel has one basic criterion two female characters have to have a conversation about something other than men ullal and muenzinger built their algorithm as a web scraper that could search for and analyze any script the user was curious about analyzing female speaking parts and combing conversations between women for male pronouns the environment at fullstack is rigorous creative and collaborative and yang and maru admit they ve worked very hard to make it that way their natural inspiration was in fact the undergraduate environment at ece illinois after graduating i realized there were so many amazing things at illinois that i took for granted yang said we owe a lot of gratitude to illinois and work hard at fullstack to create an atmosphere that illinois has by default in terms of the incredible number of extracurricular activities clubs projects and hackathons available to students

illiac two nearly identical computers based on famed mathematician john von neumann s architecture the machines were big strong and fast for their time they weighed five tons measured x x feet and had vacuum tubes kb ram and a khz clock speed the army used ordvac to perform ballistic trajectory calculations illiac provided most of the computer services for campus for years while faculty and graduate students used its computing power for their research physicist ralph meagher helped lead early computing work at illinois photo courtesy of university of illinois archives when the soviet union launched sputnik i on october professors don gillies and jim snyder programmed illiac to calculate the satellite s orbit from radio interferometer measurements collected by astronomy researchers on campus their results were published in the journal nature a month later which helped calm some of the country s apprehension about the surprise launch researchers also used illiac to run an early version of plato programmed logic for automatic teaching operations the world s first computer based education system later versions of plato introduced revolutionary technology like flat plasma displays email computer games and online communities in the s and s illiac inspired several copies and follow up work at institutions in the united states and across the world including machines like mistic silliac and cyclone in japan construction of the musasino computer was overseen by saburo muroga who had participated on the illiac team as a visiting scholar he later returned to illinois as a professor of computer science mathematician abraham taub helped lead early computing work at illinois photo courtesy of university of illinois archives although it had limitations due in large part to the undependable vacuum tube technology illiac sparked the imagination of illinois researchers like gillies jim robertson ted popplebaum david muller lloyd fosdick bill gear jack nash david williams michael faiman sylvian ray and others who would go on to develop a second generation supercomputer illiac ii led by jim robertson of srt division algorithm fame illiac ii was based on an innovative architecture that enabled the computer to run error free for weeks at a time the machine came on line in and was one of the early computers to replace vacuum tubes with transistors in fact illiac ii was times faster than its predecessor allowing for the calculation of three new mersenne prime numbers by professor don gillies in a essay the late cs professor sylvian ray noted that it was not obvious that huge speed and complexity gains could be achieved through integrated circuit technology instead researchers focused on developing highly parallel architecture in their computer design illinois researchers adhered to that thinking particularly with the illiac iv machine harold lopeman working on illiac ii photo courtesy of university of illinois archives designed by cs professor dan slotnick illiac iv pioneered an important type of parallel computation with processing elements that worked together executing the same instructions simultaneously illiac iv was one of the first experiments in large scale single instruction multiple data simd machines simd technology is still used today intel s processors utilize small simd vector units for example capable of calculating up to million instructions per second and with a one gigabit per second i o transfer rate illiac iv was the most powerful supercomputer of its time coming on line in it performed computational work in fluid dynamics digital image processing and weather forecasting for years at nasa

engineering and its world renowned national center for supercomputing applications ncsa are central to the digital lab for manufacturing professor william king from illinois department of mechanical science and engineering is the digital lab s principal investigator and will serve as its chief technical officer the challenges for manufacturing are virtually unchanged since the industrial revolution said king how do you make a high quality product and get it to your customer quickly how do you most efficiently use materials and energy today s computing and data technologies however mean that companies generate huge amounts of data about the design fabrication assembly quality shipping delivery and use of their products but that data is not aggregated in fact it s often thrown away the digital lab for manufacturing will develop data integration technologies for the manufacturing industry companies will use the resulting digital manufacturing commons to collect all of the data generated in a product s life cycle analyze that data and unlock its value developed by ge this software will be made open source through the digital lab for all its partners think of it as facebook for manufacturing a digital platform that will link innovators factories and computing said king sensors will provide data on every aspect of the product new tools will be created to model prototype and manufacture products machines on the factory floor will talk to each other entire factories will talk to each other all of that data all of those digital conversations will be internet based illinois computer scientists and engineers will help make the conversation possible and the illinois cybersecurity experts will help keep it safe president obama announced the creation of the digital lab for manufacturing at the white house on february the digital manufacturing commons will also link companies to supercomputing resources at ncsa and the experts who can make the most of them american industry has tremendous needs for st century computing and data environments it asks us to do things that can only be done with very advanced digital solutions and teams that integrate expertise from supercomputing to multi physics software environments ncsa can help create those solutions and get to work said professor edward seidel ncsa s director ncsa has worked closely with private sector partners since it was established in ultimately the challenges are complex but the mission is simple the digital lab for manufacturing will reduce costs for manufacturing transform the way work is done and spur economic growth digital manufacturing requires world changing research driven innovation the sort of innovation that has always been at the heart of pre eminence at illinois

significantly promoted technical progress in the field according to the citation for the award nahrstedt is being honored for pioneering contributions to end to end quality of service and resource management in wired and wireless networks university of illinois computer science professor klara nahrstedt nahrstedt has a long history of distinguished contributions to quality of service qos routing in the earliest phase of that work running from to she addressed the problem in the context of wired networks eventually producing a suite of leading qos routing algorithms around she turned her attention to the much greater challenge of qos routing in wireless networks whereas wired networks enjoy a physically protected environment in which strong guarantees are relatively easy to provide wireless networks are subject to highly unpredictable conditions and interference the physical environment when buses pass by you can t control nahrstedt notes you cannot control weather she responded by developing mechanisms for dealing with such disturbances by providing statistical qos guarantees in place of the tightly controlled guarantees that can be obtained for wired networks in the third and most recent major phase of this work she has studied ways to provide qos guarantees in the even more challenging context of tele immersion in tele immersion geographically separated people interact with each other within a virtual environment that strives to replicate the experience of a face to face physical interaction naturally such interaction involves stringent real time guarantees nahrstedt has been tackling ways to organize resources in order to guarantee latency in this demanding area so that it will become feasible to use tele immersion technologies in a variety of important application areas such as telemedicine it s a much much more sophisticated interactive environment than we currently have she notes today she is pursuing qos management research on multiple fronts the tele immersion work which has been supported by the national science foundation has been ongoing since in other work funded by qualcomm intel google and the boeing trusted software center in iti she has been working to address the qos problems of mobile telephones and mobile computing through grouping strategies she is developing approaches that would allow phones to help each other via collaborative groupings to illustrate the potential value of grouping technologies nahrstedt points to a tragic disaster at a concert in germany at which multiple fatalities occurred when an unexpectedly large crowd panicked and became crushed in a pedestrian tunnel she notes that the strategies she s developing could be lifesavers in such emergency situations they had mobile phones but there was no kind of peer to peer ad hoc communication that could actually inform somebody i felt that there should be phones in this kind of really tense situation with which you can push a button and get this information out finally through work in iti s trustworthy cyber infrastructure for the power grid tcipg center she is also looking at how competing qos and security demands can both be answered in the context of critical cyber physical systems such as the power grid many of these cyber physical systems have been quite isolated and operated under the assumption of getting real time very fast information to their control centers she explains introduction of the internet and other computing resources has been making these systems less isolated the interesting aspect is that as the barriers were removed more attacks started to happen but the basic requirements in terms of quality of service have stayed so the interesting thing is how can security fit in and not violate the real time requirements nahrstedt has been on the faculty of the department of computer science at illinois since and has received numerous prior honors including the ieee communications society leonard g abraham prize the university scholar award and the humboldt research award among others she is a fellow of the ieee the ieee computer society is widely considered the world s leading organization of

classes students in the cs class spent their semester applying their skills in distributed systems to the task of learning to develop distributed applications on top of the google android development platform the google phones purchase was sponsored by the vodafone educational grant the semester culminated in a head to head competition sponsored by qualcomm and vodafone to see who could create the best learning focused application the course and the applications are a part of a new research project underway at illinois computer science called mobile learning communities mlc the mlc project aims to enable students to share trusted educational services with each other via google phones iphones and other mobile devices the team is tackling the challenge from every angle multimedia social computing distributed systems networking educational technology communication and trust student projects in cs were the first set of student driven technologies in the project the ultimate goal is to create a peer to peer networking community as well as a shared repository for many more of these kinds of student developed applications the cs competition was judged by faculty from computer science as well as a representative from qualcomm s research development team dr dave craig dave had some tips for the student developers before the competition the number one challenge in creating mobile applications is that it s just different there are display restrictions debugging restrictions and logging and instrumentation restrictions that you aren t used to if you ve been programming exclusively on and for desktop type applications said craig craig sees classes and competitions like prof nahrstedt s as essential for any student wanting to get into mobile application development as more and more computing moves to a mobile platform where applications can come to the user rather than the user going to the applications the distinctions between stationary and mobile computing are getting more blurry according to craig applications are really starting to mature which will engender a whole new productivity using the network the applications developed by the cs students leveraged these new capabilities and productivity to create a suite of applications designed with student life in mind drawing from their own experiences as students and with class experiences fresh in their minds the students produced new applications to help both in and out of class a look at the winning applications g clicker hyun duk kim chia chia lin hee dong jung members of the winning g clicker team with prof klara nahrstedt and dr dave craig g clicker is a google phone application that aims to create an interactive education environment with today s tools instructors often encounter obstacles when trying to interact with the entire class instructors can get responses from only some of students and always struggle with repeating announcements or pointing students where to download materials to solve these problems we proposed g clicker an advanced tool which greatly enhances interactions between instructors and students said kim we believe it will create a much more effective education environment g clicker provides functions like instant quiz class material distribution announcement posting notifying instructor and voice message recording through g phone indoor localization wee hong yeo yun wei chang samuel retika the indoor localization tool allows user to locate its position indoors using wifi signals fingerprinting two views are created for the user the map view and the real view the map view shows the floor plan of the building at various details it allows the user to scroll or zoom the map the real view shows what the user sees through the android s phone camera and utilizes the compass and accelerometer to further determine orientation the application will show the user position as well as other peers position in both views different categories of points of interests pois can be drawn on top of either views allowing the user to navigate around the building quiz application craig mcintyre ohm patel michael ford to make the student professor interaction simpler and more involved we created an android based quiz system similar to the iclicker that is being used by students today said patel referring to the iclicker education system developed by a group of physics professors at illinois the quiz system is a hefty approach to accomplishing all the tasks required in administering quizzes through the server s web front end the professor has the ability to create quizzes start and stop quizzes view grades check attendance and more using an android enabled device students can participate in quizzes save their answers review their grades and even check in for attendance the main goal of the quiz system is to enable students to learn interactively and enable professors to educate at a higher level students in system

security establish major resilient smart grid program at the university of illinois jenny applequist information trust institute mon by jenny applequist information trust institute in recent months the media have been buzzing with talk about the smart grid especially since then president elect barack obama featured the need for new smart grid technology in a january speech on the economy now the information trust institute iti at the university of illinois at urbana champaign and its partner institutions have been recruited to contribute towards the ongoing development of a resilient secure smart grid in the united states following the announcement of a major award of research support from the u s department of energy with contributions from the u s department of homeland security several computer science faculty members including professors roy campbell carl gunter klara nahrstedt and marianne winslett will lead projects and initiatives related to the new center including efforts into quantitative and qualitative validation secure and reliable computing base and communications and control protocols the award of nearly million over a five year period to illinois dartmouth college the university of california at davis and washington state university will fund an ambitious new research program called trustworthy cyber infrastructure for the power grid tcipg it reflects a strong consensus that cyber security and resilience will be critical to the realization of a modernized reliable and efficient power grid able to guarantee delivery of electricity to consumers and maintain critical operations even when malicious cyber attacks occur research and development of cyber security tools and technologies for critical controls systems such as the power grid are among our top priorities said dr douglas maughan program manager within the command control and interoperability division of the department of homeland security s science and technology directorate we re excited to continue working with the department of energy and the university of illinois and its partners in this area of critical need for our nation s security the term smart grid refers to the integration of the existing physical infrastructure of the power grid with an advanced communication and control cyber infrastructure with the ultimate goal of making energy transmission and distribution more efficient and therefore cheaper for consumers and less wasteful of resources however smart grid technologies may themselves introduce new problems such as increasing the vulnerability to cyber attack as power grid resources become increasingly linked to the internet for example experts recently warned that some types of smart automated meters could be hacked by attackers with minimal equipment and knowledge and a that an attacker who succeeded in gaining access might be able to cause blackouts those blackouts could have serious economic and human consequences if they are widespread or affect critical systems such as airports or city traffic light systems ultimately the extent to which the smart grid vision is achieved is going to depend on how functional and robust the cyber infrastructure is explained ilesanmi adesida dean of the college of engineering at illinois smart grid technologies should be able to offer us increased protection against accidents and against adversaries who might want to deliberately harm the power grid who might include well funded highly motivated criminal organizations or even nation states not just casual hackers the concern is that the existing technologies can t offer those guarantees and that we could even open the door to new risks if we carelessly put together new systems that don t have resilience and security guarantees built in from the ground up that s where the tcipg work is going to make a big difference industry experts and regulatory bodies seem to be unanimous in saying that resilience and cyber security are critical areas of concern for the future power grid the interconnectedness of the emerging smart grid presents cyber security challenges explains dave whitehead vice president of research development for schweitzer engineering laboratories inc of pullman washington a company that works on power system technologies the tcipg researchers have spent years developing solutions to the challenging cyber security problems that are inherent to such complex systems the new support from the doe and dhs is going to give them the opportunity to pursue even more innovations dr arshad mansour a vice president at the electric power research institute epri agreed that cyber security is a key component in the development of a smarter grid epri looks forward to continuing to work with the tcipg team in this critical area the tcipg team s past research has been conducted with the active participation of more than power industry entities which will continue to be involved in the new project the tcipg research team members have been collaborating on work in this area since under national science foundation funding their efforts have been devoted to development of resilient cyber infrastructure that is trustworthy survivable and efficient accomplishments to date include a range of hardware and software solutions including a highly efficient technique for protecting message exchanges in existing already deployed power systems and a strategy for managing complex security policies in large networks that may have thousands of rules controlling who can access what tcipg researchers have also addressed the security weakness of smart meters through development of an attestation strategy that can detect modifications to software on the meters thus helping to block attacks and also thwart customers who try to lower their power bills by tampering with their meters the new tcipg research program will involve the development and

they have become a prime target for malicious attacks two illinois computer science phd students are studying ways to improve the security of these real time embedded systems and were recently selected for the prestigious qualcomm innovation fellowship qinf cs grad students man ki yoon left and fardin abdi taghi abad received a fellowship from qualcomm for their research and presentation on

in the qualcomm research centers qinf is open to students at top u s electrical engineering and computer science schools in proposals were submitted and eight teams were awarded fellowships along with two honorable mention teams the great thing about this award is that some of the research qualcomm has been doing is very similar to what we proposed and we didn t know that beforehand yoon said we heard from them when we presented and that s important because if this big company is doing these things that means what we re doing has quite a big impact yoon and abdi taghi abad s work focuses on

information trust institute s research scientist sibin mohan as well as cs professors lui sha and marco caccamo lead yoon and abdi taghi abad respectively this research effort embedded systems are all around us from mobile phones to modern automobiles from aircraft to smart homes satellites to power grids mohan said every year billions of embedded processors are sold for these and other operations as a result any security breaches or vulnerabilities in such systems can have a catastrophic impact one or two decades ago these systems were usually isolated and were not connected to networks or each other so there were few security concerns the problem lies in that these systems are becoming more vulnerable as they gain more functionality and connectivity mohan said nowadays mobile phones can connect to cars power grid components have becomes smarter where they can be monitored controlled over the internet he said hence attackers are also able to find methods to penetrate such systems and cause problems according to mohan traditional security techniques don t always translate easily into this realm because most embedded systems lack the processing power or energy to implement extensive security protocols yoon and abdi taghi abad s proposal looks to develop new and innovative means to protect these embedded systems by inspecting their normal daily behaviors and looking for deviations they intend to use minor processor architecture modifications to implement this and hence detect attacks normally embedded systems have very predictable behavior because it s doing a similar job over and over and there isn t much variance in the behavior abdi taghi abad said the detection technique they are planning to create will track for example the normal system behaviors including execution timing memory access and i o usage patterns this will allow them to detect differences from legitimate behavior and declare whether or not an attack has occurred the fellowship will officially begin in august and will last through august they will be mentored by dr mihai christodorescu as well as dr rajarshi gupta who both work at qualcomm research silicon valley winning this fellowship will provide man ki and fardin access to qualcomm researchers that work on the cutting edge problems and issues mohan said they can hopefully get to work on real world data sets and architectures that will make the research efforts stronger it also provides high visibility due to the competitive nature of the fellowship and by the very fact that qualcomm itself publicizes the awards both students look forward to collaborating with researchers who are in touch with industry and working to complement the research already happening at qualcomm now that we have some mentors in

make mistakes and formal methods are still short of fully automating the process our architecture should automatically deal with mistakes in ways that do not jeopardize vehicle safety the project leverages architectural advances developed by illinois computer science prof lui sha that significantly reduce the cost of embedded software development sha s work largely used in avionics has demonstrated ways to structure software systems so that it is easy to prove safety and stability even if large parts of code contain bugs and are not fully tested the main idea is simple says sha unverified code that is not fully tested can be allowed to operate as long as it performs well one needs only to understand when a critical situation is about to develop and intervene by resorting to a trusted albeit perhaps less feature rich mode of operation until the danger is resolved the combination of highly optimized complex and feature rich components together with simple but provably correct ones augmented with validated switch over logic is known as the simplex architecture developed by sha illinois computer science professor lui sha this project also leverages professor caccamo s research on real time co scheduling of computing resources meeting real time requirements is critical for control systems traditionally each type of computing resource cpu cache and i o channels is scheduled independently this method no longer works well in tightly integrated modern microprocessors where the activities on one resource can interfere with the activities on others with the spiraling cost of software development and testing in off road vehicles this project has the capacity both to maintain high reliability of future off road machines and to pass cost savings to consumers of agricultural products leading to a stronger off road vehicle industry and safer farming at lower cost media contacts media inquiries may be directed to tom moone associate director of

has five apples and seven oranges and he wants to share them with three of his friends can a computer understand the text to figure out how many pieces of fruit each person gets thanks to new software developed at the university of illinois machines now can learn to understand mathematical reasoning expressed in language which could greatly improve search engines and access to data as well as boost mathematics education cs graduate student subhro roy left and professor dan roth developed software to help computers understand math concepts expressed in text this will improve data accessibility search and education photo by l brian stauffer cs professor dan roth and graduate student subhro roy published their work in the journal transactions of the association for computational linguistics there is a lot of data available in news archives and public records but it cannot be accessed in a meaningful way roth said for example if people want to know what percentage of a state s budget has been spent on education over the past years a query like that won t give the desired result with a keyword search performed today in a search engine like google but if the engine were able to do quantitative reasoning it would infer from the text the type of information the user is looking for it can find the numbers then calculate the percentages and addition required to do this the first hurdle and the biggest challenge was in teaching the computer to identify quantities and units in text regardless of how they are expressed something humans do unconsciously when reading secondly the software has to decide what to do with the identified numbers in the problem with johnny for example the computer has to understand that both apples and oranges are fruit it has to know that the words five seven and three are equivalent to the numerical values and it has to determine what kind of operation s the question requires in this case addition and division and in which order to conduct those operations once the program has converted the text into an equation it can easily compute that johnny and his friends each have three pieces of fruit the computer also has to be able to determine the different equation corresponding to the text if for example the text had said that johnny wanted to split the fruit among his three friends instead of sharing the fruit with them in that case the subtle change in the language implies that each of the friends would receive four pieces of fruit with johnny keeping none for himself such sophisticated reasoning is required for search queries as well when accessing a text regarding financial earnings for instance the computer has to identify whether an amount is exact or approximate static or dynamic a range presented in relation to something else and all of the other contextual cues that a reader would inherently understand the computer reads two pounds two pounds of what or is it referencing currency what about monetary conversions roth said if you talk about dates it gets even harder i could say the week after thanksgiving or the first week in december or december to you and me it means the same thing but a keyword search can t equate them the researchers tested their software s abilities to identify and normalize quantities in text to perform searches regarding monetary currencies and to understand and solve elementary school level math word problems they found that the software performed well in all tasks it even outperformed the average elementary level student on standardized word problems roth said getting percent of answers correct roth hopes that the ability to understand numbers in context will help make information more accessible to all from researchers looking for correlations to investors looking for clear financial data to citizens seeking to form educated opinions he also hopes that using technology to break down mathematical concepts can help students improve their own quantitative reasoning abilities as we move forward and want to help kids understand math it makes sense to use technology roth said if you search the web today you see tons of web pages that help kids and parents with math homework so we know this is a challenge for people if a program were able to understand text and word problems to the extent that you can see what the variables are and what you should focus on in the problem that could help people learn better this shows that computers could help people learn in ways that could not be done before the army research laboratory and the defense advanced

staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news roth s startup nexlp develops automated document understanding by tom moone cs illinois tue if you were to give most people a single email message and ask them to report back with a brief report of the contents and a list of the key players in the message most anyone would be able to do it fairly quickly if you gave them say email messages and sufficient extra time they could probably do the same again if you were to hand email messages things would likely start to break down but this is just the type of scenario that many corporations are finding themselves in particularly where legal aspects are involved legal proceedings can now require the review of thousands of submitted documents including memos and email messages the only way to get through these and determine what documents may be of relevance was to hire many many people to skim and make judgments on the applicability of document now however a startup company nexlp co founded by cs professor dan roth an expert in natural language processing is developing an automation process for reviewing the vast amounts of documents that can be found in legal proceedings dan roth if you give me k messages which you can never read what we can do immediately is tell you who are the key entities that are involved in this huge collection of data said roth who are the people that are mentioned the most what they talk about and with whom what are the locations organizations and other entities and topics that are mentioned the most we can slice it different ways basically the core technology of nexlp is the tools that we ve been developing here over the last years or so said roth nexlp has licensed roth s technology from the university of illinois to develop this into a marketable product techstars a big boost for nexlp came when it was named one of the techstars chicago class of each year companies are selected for the chicago techstars summer program of mentoring business coaching and networking in addition the techstars program provides funding legal services travel assistance cloud services and several other incentives the companies in the chicago program receive office space in the facility for the duration of the techstars program the key thing is they give companies intensive coaching in how to run a company how to build a company how to interact with venture capitalists said roth being selected to techstars is prestigious for up and coming companies and many keep reference to that affiliation the techstars website indicates that companies that have taken part in the program have gone on to raise an average of million in outside capital in august the companies give a final demo of their product it is at that point that companies could solicit additional venture capital assistance but roth thinks nexlp may not need that we already have sales he said we have already sold the product to a couple of companies and we have pilot installations in maybe ten companies already market penetration one reason that nexlp may not need additional venture capital funding is that the other founders of the company have experience working within the legal community roth s fellow co founders ye chen jay leib kit mackie and alan rosen bring years of it experience in the legal market to bear on the company one reason i found this an interesting opportunity is that several of the people who founded this company with me are extremely knowledgeable about this legal area roth explained they know the domain well they know what people care about they know the community this knowledge of the legal community makes it easier to penetrate the market and the company has been getting some press from such outlets as the law technology news this could definitely help them with getting their product into the hands of the legal community this community is a relatively conservative community roth said they are not known for adopting quickly high tech things we have to figure out how to convince them and once they have settled into the legal market roth sees other avenues for developing the technology as we move on there s a lot of areas in big data where companies have a lot of unstructured data and they have issues of compliance data security of different sorts inside information even internal spying patents and stuff like this they need to know what s in their data collection as long as there are increasing amounts of data roth sees

what life was like before and how life is much different after such is the case with the big data movement harnessing the power of computers and supercomputers to draw insights from massive amounts of information that power will unlock mysteries across scientific and societal boundaries in a variety of fields from genomics environmental engineering and high energy physics to law enforcement and security illinois is in a unique position amongst academic institutions because of its long history in computing and data said bill kramer project director for blue waters the national science foundation funded sustained petascale supercomputer at the national center for supercomputing applications ncsa the university has the critical mix of people who understand the methods people who understand the physical resources and people who understand the investigative goals as one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world blue waters became fully operational last spring although blue waters is the fastest supercomputer on a university campus it is just one piece of the computing puzzle as a world leader in computing and information technology illinois traces its computational roots back to the original vacuum tube illiac generations of mainframe supercomputers as well as world changing innovations such as plato and mosaic today big data is a key element of the grainger engineering breakthroughs initiative supported by a million gift to the college of engineering more than million of that support funds big data initiatives and more than a dozen new senior faculty in the field the science of big data in the same manner in which mathematics is the science for dealing with reasoning big data is going to be the way you think about the relationships and causal effects of observations in the world explained cs professor roy campbell you may have millions of data points but you can still reason and use it in a methodical scientific approach that s where the science is going to emerge from in this discussion some of those principles come from machine learning some from statistics and some are based on visualizing results so you can deliver valuable insights to the people who can use that information roy campbell campbell reports that the amount of data in the world is increasing by about percent each year in addition to taking that data to analyze the past more and more big data will be used to predict how society will behave in future situations unstructured data kramer points to three kinds of data structured data that comes from simulation observational data that comes largely from experiments and tools like telescopes or particle accelerators and unstructured data unstructured data is the untidy compilation of video and text that we produce daily as a society inside and outside of scientific research dan roth dan roth has been at the forefront of research in natural language understanding and machine learning roth and his team have developed tools that can analyze human language categorize it parse it semantically and wikify it disambiguate it and map snippets of text to the relevant wikipedia pages these tools are used by numerous researchers and some commercial companies to access text in more sophisticated ways than a keyword search which is used by search engines such as google until years ago most of the data the corporations and agencies had was in databases roth noted today between and percent is textual data therefore you have to be able to figure out how to deal with unstructured data among the beneficiaries of this method is medicine where over a million articles are written each year and a lot more textual electronic records are generated by caretakers for example a physician goes to see a patient and wants to know something about their medical history but that history is pages long roth explained the doctor doesn t have time to look at the pages to determine what it relevant we are developing automatic tools that will allow people to access the data in a more sensible way as researchers develop new ways to extract information roth is also leading an effort for associating credibility and trustworthiness to data that we are all exposed to on the web and the sources that provide the data societal impact as these tools develop data scientists will further impact quality of life perhaps doing things like predicting weather events and analyzing traffic patterns the upsides are compelling for all sorts of reasons campbell explained we can actually determine what gets in the way of having a great life it is the engineering motto in some sense if you are really going to improve society then you re going to have to find the truths underlying all the different parts of society and give it to everyone pete nardulli a professor of political science and the director of the cline center for democracy at illinois has been using data science tools to help extract information on civil strife our main interest is in societal development and the role institutions play nardulli said these days civil strife is such an important factor in development the center has

of the internet made huge amount of information instantly available to humans and computers alike however when different sources make contradictory claims or provide partial pieces of information and each may have their own sometimes hidden motivations in doing so we don t know what to believe in other words what information is trustworthy illinois computer science professor dan roth the area of information trustworthiness is being researched by university of illinois computer science professor dan roth with support of a faculty research award from google roth s work in information trust was detailed in a recent paper entitled comprehensive trust metrics for information networks which won a best paper award at the recent th army science conference this paper studies the premise of truthfulness completeness and bias of information reported roth says given that it s so easy to publish today and even once reliable sources need to compete and publish very quickly there are many voices clamoring for attention on the on line media blogs etc it is difficult to sift through it all to figure out who s telling the truth and who s not to know what to believe ideally we would like to identify those sources documents and facts we would trust if we had the time and ability to consider all the information that is available and incorporate it with the background knowledge and beliefs we have then we can select which news article report or more importantly which on line medical advice to believe roth s work in this direction will focus on the development of a mechanism for determining trust that can be reliably substituted for the user s own informed judgment even in domains where being fully informed is human infeasible i e one cannot read every document on the web but we can still use google to search them we must also determine exactly what we mean by trustworthiness of information and formalize the problem so that meaningful evaluation is possible as a simple example of the type of problem that we have when discerning the trustworthiness of information consider that one author claims mumbai is the largest city in the world and another claims it is seoul who do we believe one or both authors could be intentionally lying honestly mistaken or just have different viewpoints of what constitutes a city is it the city proper or does it include the metropolitan area truth in this case is not objective there may be many valid definitions of city but we should believe the claim that accords with our user s viewpoint the real problem is of course much broader and far reaching it has to do with forming political views based on truthful or not so facts presented about past and present event about the truthfulness of the sources our kids learn from about product reviews and about medical advice so commonly available today on the web with very little ability of the user of verifying its trustworthiness trustworthiness of information is a problem our society needs to address as computer scientists we have to begin developing a principled approach to this difficult problem there are multiple challenges here from the problem of retrieving relevant evidence to that of dealing with conflicting claims to developing a level of trust that agrees with one s subjective beliefs and common sense knowledge prof roth is professor of

networks such as those utilized on the battlefield by the army and its soldiers prof jiawei han modern warfare and military missions demand superior mastery of information and data of various forms such data and information may be massive in volume generated from multiple sources interrelated and connected by logical relationships sometimes defined by the underlying physical network or the social network above said consortium director and illinois computer science professor jiawei han most existing network modeling and analysis methods consider homogeneous static networks however networks in the real world are heterogeneous interacting and evolving this poses great challenges in terms of effectiveness scalability and comprehensive analysis of such information networks and especially so for the case of military networks addressing information network challenges in this environment requires a multi disciplinary approach that breaks new ground and builds on existing research in communication information and social and cognitive research the inarc center will bring together a team of world class researchers in several disciplines with illinois as the principal

computer science professors from the university of illinois at urbana champaign are part of a million effort to develop new computing techniques and approaches for identifying children at risk for autism and other developmental delays as part of the effort professors karrie karahalios and david forsyth will develop novel computational methods to measure and analyze the behavior of children and adults during face to face social interactions the two will be working with researchers from georgia tech carnegie mellon mit boston university the university of pittsburgh the university of south california as part of an nsf expeditions grant led by georgia tech autism affects in children in the u s with a lifetime cost of care of million per person current best practices for evaluating behavior and assessing risk are based on direct observation by highly trained specialists it s likely early asd diagnoses lead to better treatment outcomes but screening young children is difficult and so many children are not screened enter computing the team hopes that by developing methods to automatically collect fine grained behavioral data this project will enable large scale objective screening and more effective delivery and assessment of therapy the project will develop multiple sensing technologies including vision speech and wearable sensors to obtain a comprehensive integrated portrait of expressed behavior people can show they re engaged with gaze gestures expressions body posture and tone of voice said forsyth so the project will use many different sensing modes to get a comprehensive portrait of what subjects are doing illinois computer science professor david forsyth the project will be developing unique capabilities for synchronizing multiple sensor streams including cameras microphones and wearable sensors and then using these streams to measure behavior we ll develop methods to model interactions between people said forsyth to help screen for asd and help therapists know the best time to encourage or discourage a behavior karahalios will expand her existing research into the use of speech visualization technologies and techniques to teach children with autism spectrum disorder how to create speech to date karahalios and her team have visualized vocalization in the form of utterances phonemes and syllables in real time children and clinicians use the visual feedback to modify their vocal behavior and to provide a metric for improvement illinois computer science professor karrie karahalios the goal of her new effort is to move from utterances and syllables to words and phrases additionally the team will develop visualizations to aggregate data from doctor s visits for early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd by visualizing performance of an evaluation metric called rapid abc there are many ways that technology can augment diagnosis and therapy one of the things we stress is that we do not want the technology to replace the clinicians or therapists but rather to aid them in their work and provide a context visualizations of mass data sets may reveal patterns that are get unknown provide new insights to parents and clinicians alike the long term goal of the overall project is the creation of a new scientific discipline of computational behavioral science which draws equally from computer science and psychology in order to transform the study of human behavior we hope to build technologies that will allow us to observe how people behave in a wide range of settings for long periods of time said forsyth data could help everyone from architects who might build better buildings to marketers to therapists to support their long term goal the research team plans comprehensive educational activities including a new interdisciplinary summer school for young researchers and the development of new courses in computational behavior in addition the team will be extending their on going and

computer science professor karrie karahalios has received a sloan foundation fellowship award for her work into human computer interaction specifically in social computing illinois computer science professor karrie karahalios karahalios s work primarily investigates sociable systems for mediated communication her current research includes projects on assistive and adaptive technologies visualization to understand conversational dynamics and understanding tie strength in social networks karrie s work in the area of social interaction has some really incredible real world implications and is making great advances to her field she s not just pioneering methods and technologies in hci but is also pioneering how people actually should do hci research said rob a rutenbar abel bliss professor of engineering and head of the computer science department we are proud that her work has been honored with such a prestigious award karahalios has received renown for her recent work to create speech visualization tools to assist children with autistic spectrum disorders her work has aided children with asd to learn how to vocalize and to have more normal conversational patterns of speech she and her students are currently expanding their work in that realm to create tools to help family members better empathize with the communication struggles that their loved ones face each day originally conceived as an art project her work in this area has taken on a variety of forms and is now informing new works into visualization tools to better understand conversational dynamics and to find ways to archive spoken word i would never have anticipated the path that this work has taken said karahalios given that history it seems only natural that the next evolution of karahalios s work is to study the sometimes strange paths that information flow can take she and her team are preparing now to start new projects to better understand how tie strength might affect information flow through social networks in a certain sense sociologists really got lucky when the internet was invented because now they have all sorts of new ways to study their field remarked karahalios what we as computer scientists have now is not only a wealth of data through the internet but also great inspiration from sociologists to learn more about how we interact using computing and technologies building on work to model and predict tie strength that recently earned phd student eric gilbert a best paper award at chi the premier conference on human computer interaction karahalios and her team will be studying so called small world problems in the context of social networks using tie strength to understand how people transmit information the work has a variety of practical implications from emergency and disaster response to questions of social influence a better understanding of how information flows through social networks might also have journalistic economic and market implications the group has recently launched a tool called wemeddle for twitter the tool is based on their early work into tie strength and creates automated lists for you based on the ties within your social network the wemeddle lists enable social media users to better focus their time checking status updates and tweets the site also includes a client that allows users to explore their stream of tweets using social zooming an approach to search via connection strength another nascent project in karahalios lab is a new form of search tools taking contextual search to a whole new level inspired by research for alzheimer s patients karahalios and her team have just launched a project to help people find files or other artifacts on their computer based on what they remember doing at the time they last saw or worked with the file the tool runs in the background of your computer capturing thousands of movements and screen actions so it can bring up the context of what you were doing or working on in any point in time in a sense a high tech way of retracing your steps to find your lost keys for example if you remember that you were listening to green day had youtube up and were working on an excel sheet you could type those cues into the tool and it would retrieve instances of your computer screen based on those factors explained karahalios karahalios credits her phd students and her research team for the cutting edge nature of her work the students in the social spaces group are not afraid to tackle the difficult problems and are very creative in their approaches to potential solutions i am proud to work with them the sloan fellowship awards are intended to enhance the careers of the very best young faculty members in specified fields of science the sloan fellowship awards are highly competitive involving nominations from the very best scientists of this generation from the united states and canada a total of fellowships are awarded annually in seven fields chemistry computational and evolutionary molecular biology computer science economics mathematics neuroscience and physics awards were made in the computer science field this year the sloan research fellowships

academic integrity as a faculty and a community of scholars we value ethics and integrity every bit as much as we value academic excellence we assume and expect that you will behave ethically honestly and with the highest degree of integrity befitting a scholar you are expected to adopt the following code of honor to demonstrate your commitment to these principles as a member of the university of illinois academic community i pledge to conduct myself in accordance with the highest standards of academic integrity what does this mean in order to better understand your responsibilities you should read the rest of this document which outlines university and cs department policies what is cheating the university s student code with which all students are expected to be familiar describes in detail many types of breaches of academic integrity including cheating plagiarism and fabrication among others read section of the student code now here we use the term cheating to mean any of the types of infractions described in the code the engineering college also has a guide to academic integrity for engineering students with which you should be familiar there are no good reasons to cheat but there are many reasons not to cheating devalues your own degree and that of others it is unfair to other students in the class often it sacrifices your own long term educational goals for perceived short term gains you stand a high likelihood of being caught and receiving a lower grade perhaps a failing one in the course cs students have been expelled from the university for cheating acting ethically acting ethically goes beyond simply not cheating for example it is ethical and important to report students who you suspect have cheated to your professors as failure to do so may result in honest students receiving lower grades in a course that grades on a curve you are urged to read the acm code of ethics for a more complete description of the high standards set by cs professionals also as mentioned above you should read the engineering college s guide to academic integrity for engineering students what is allowed in cs courses the university definitions that you ve read apply to cs classes and clearly cover infractions such as copying on exams or written assignments for programming assignments as with most assignments it is fine to discuss the concepts with your classmates or anyone else and indeed you are often encouraged to do so however when it comes to writing the program even just the pseudo code you must do it yourself unless the instructor has said otherwise a typical course policy may be that you may talk to anyone but as soon as you start to write your solution or type it you should work alone in other words if you are copying text directly from someone else whether copying files or typing from someone else s notes or typing while they dictate then you are cheating committing plagiarism to be more exact this is true regardless of whether the source is a classmate a former student a website a program listing found in the trash or whatever furthermore plagiarism even on a small part of the program is cheating also starting out with code that you did not write and modifying it to look like your own is cheating as described in the student code aiding someone else s cheating also constitutes cheating leaving your program in plain sight or leaving a computer without logging out thereby leaving your programs open to copying may constitute cheating depending upon the circumstances consequently you should always take care to prevent others from copying your programs as it certainly leaves you open to accusations of cheating if somebody else hands in code identical to yours you may be penalized finally anything written here should not be taken to supercede the particular policies applied by individual professors it is your responsibility to determine exactly what type of interaction with other people may be allowed what resources may be consulted etc in each of your cs classes if the course web page does not list a policy you should ask your instructor to publicize one sanctions cheating in computer science classes is a serious problem as it devalues the hard work of honest students therefore the department is determined to eliminate it by making the chances of getting caught high enough and the sanctions severe enough that any student considering cheating will choose instead to just do their best honestly even if it means a low grade on our campus professors have very wide discretion in determining what constitutes cheating in their classes and what sanctions will be applied however the department has adopted the following guidelines professors are encouraged to apply sanctions at least as severe as these if the facts warrant you should be sure you understand the particular course policy some course web pages may simply link to this page for the course cheating policy recommended sanctions for cheating in a cs course first offense for cheating on an exam zero on the exam on a programming assignment quiz or written homework zero on the assignment and final course grade is lowered by one whole letter grade multiple instances of cheating of any kind failure in the course other penalties as noted above an instructor has wide flexibility in imposing sanctions and may be either more strict or more lenient than this note that all cases in which a student has been found to have

directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news high performance computing in the pcast report professor william gropp wed the president s committee of advisors on science and technology is charged to among other things review federal investment in research and development for networking and information technology nit the recent report designing a digital future federally funded research and development in networking and information technology argues that nit is critical to a wide range of national priorities and urges broad and sustained support for research this is a long and detailed report with over pages and it has a lot of good stuff in it here s the time for the disclaimer i was a member of the working committee that helped draft the report i d like to focus on the recommendations related to high performance computing hpc william gropp paul and cynthia saylor professor of computer science a principal investigator on the blue waters sustained petaflop supercomputer and the deputy director for research of the institute for advanced computing applications and technologies the report recognizes the key role that hpc has played and continues to play in many of the nation s priorities including health energy and national security in fact computing has become so important to a broad range of activities that many federal agencies make extensive use of computing not just hpc to perform their mission just how important is this one way is to follow the money the total federal expenditure in nit r d is about billion a significant fraction of this is in a category labeled hpc r d this makes it look like a significant fraction of the nation s investment in information technology research is going into hpc but these figures are misleading because of the often opaque way that federal expenditures are reported the cost of the computing infrastructure used in performing research in areas like medicine astrophysics and materials science was included in the nitrd budget figures much under a category called hpc research and development this greatly overstates the amount of investment in nit research and development by conflating research that relies on the use of high performance computers with research into improving high performance computing but it does underscore the key role of computing in many fields the report calls for the budget figures to make clear what is being spent on nit r d and what is being spent on the infrastructure to make use of computing however the size of the funding devoted to the use of computing in general and hpc in particular is strong evidence of the continued importance of hpc we are always looking for a way to identify the best strongest and fastest hpc is no different and hpc systems have historically been ranked by a single benchmark the results are posted twice a year as the top list which is usually dominated by the united states a chinese system placed at the top of the most recent list in november raising questions about whether u s leadership in hpc had come to an end however being on the top of this list does not mean that the system is the most effective for solving a wide range of problems the benchmark used for the top performs a computation that stresses just one part of a system the rate at which floating point operations can be performed this focus on floating point operations neglects system characteristics that are often more important for applications such as the rate at which data can be moved within the system while the hpc community has long known that no single benchmark adequately captures the usefulness of a system the pcast report explicitly calls for a greater focus on what i ll call sustained performance the ability to compute effectively on a wide range of problems but the goal of our investment in hpc should be to solve computational problems that address our current national priorities addressing this is becoming critical because developing systems based solely to rank at the top of the top list will not provide the computational tools needed for productive science and engineering research the last few decades have seen both a tremendous expansion in computing capability along with an unparalleled stability in computing methods applications that were written years ago can run with little or no change even on some of the largest parallel systems this business as usual approach to high end computing though astoundingly effective for several decades is nearing its end it isn t just one barrier to further progress but many while the end of moore s law and the rapid gains in performance that have gone with it has been predicted in the past this time it may be for real at least in terms of performance in the past as one barrier to progress appeared we were able to make some tradeoff to continue progress for example until recently processor clock rates kept increasing but this required the acceptance of ever larger power requirements to the point where the processors in a laptop can cause burns and supercomputers require megawatts or more to operate but we are running out of tradeoffs to make building the next few generations of high end machines using today s technology or even the natural evolution of today s technologies will not be effective in addition to the technical challenges systems designed along the lines of current systems will be very costly with the risk that paying for these systems will not leave enough resources with which to create the next computing revolution to avoid this fate the report calls for

applications thu with guidance from professors wen mei hwu electrical and computer engineering bill gropp computer science and cluster experts at ncsa students got hands on experience building their own supercomputer with nvidia graphics processing units when the green list of energy efficient supercomputers was posted nov their system took third place overall and was named the greenest self built cluster for tyler takeshita helping to construct a supercomputer was like meeting a familiar friend in person for the first time takeshita a graduate student in chemistry at the university of illinois has been interested in computers since a young age and belongs to a computational research group led by chemistry professor thom dunning director of the national center for supercomputing applications ncsa he felt that in order to take his knowledge to the next level he needed to delve right inside the system it was very helpful to get hands on experience takeshita said it was almost like putting a face to the name when you have an idea of what things look like and how they fit together takeshita along with around other students participated in building a supercomputer to enter into the green competition a ranking of the most energy efficient supercomputers in the world the project is part of an independent study course led by bill gropp the bill and cynthia saylor professor of computer science and wen mei hwu the amd jerry sanders chair of electrical and computer engineering ncsa s mike showerman provided cluster building expertise and assistance the idea is kind of original because it s not trying to use a big machine that consumes a lot of energy to be really fast computer science major chengyin liu said we were interested in efficient power consuming i found the idea very interesting according to showerman the first step was selecting the perfect equipment in this case that was nvidia s c graphics processing unit gpu while gpus were originally developed to render graphics today they are being adopted as computational accelerators with the proper software adaptations some codes can run substantially faster using gpus many core architecture even as the students were building their cluster china announced that their gpu cpu hybrid machine tianhe ia was the fastest supercomputer in the world nvidia donated c units to the illinois cuda center of excellence led by hwu and nvidia research scientist sean treichler spent time on campus helping to plan and build the cluster qlogic also donated a portion of the interconnect treichler said donating the technology seemed like a great opportunity for nvidia we are interested in researching power efficient computing he said and working with students was great they have a lot of good ideas that aren t mainstream they often have new ideas for old problems treichler said the students had some good ideas when it came to connecting everything together in a creative way to save money and reduce the cluster s footprint the team used nontraditional materials like wood and plexiglass to mount the motherboards the students had three big sessions working tirelessly in the new national petascale computing facility to build the cluster which is currently called ecog but might be rechristened green street in honor of one of the campus s main thoroughfares they also needed to configure all of the settings and check each memory card processor and cable for problems before finally running benchmark code to test their cluster s performance and another test to gather power usage data by the deadline for the top list a ranking of the fastest supercomputers in the world finally the team recorded performance of teraflops or trillion calculations per second and megaflops per watt the cluster landed spot on the top list and then took third place when the green was posted on nov ecog won an additional green honor as the greenest self built supercomputer showerman still feels the project was a success said illinois will likely continue to have cluster building classes in coming years there is a value in learning that s what higher education is all about he said but is it valid to leave the university knowing things but not having the ability to do anything this project was very unique in that it gave students access to something few people ever have the opportunity to do now that it s built the cluster will continue to be a teaching and research tool we will use the cluster to conduct studies on how real applications may need to be adapted to run well on such power constrained systems said hwu this will likely be the norm in exascale computers in the next decade showerman said there are also people interested in using the cluster for physics and chemistry applications we are already running some physics codes on the system with good performance results he said media contacts media inquiries may be directed to tom moone associate director of communications moone at

and brett jones they are standing in front of the display they used for the cozad competition karsch is holding the certificate they received when they won the cozad competition projection mapping is the process of turning everyday objects into immersive and interactive displays currently this is an expensive process requiring several experts working for weeks or months on a particular project depending on complexity these displays are seen in such venues as auto shows concerts or other large settings like this although projection mapping has been around since the late s the process for creating these experiences has not progressed all that much sodhi explained that compared to photo manipulation projection mapping is a lot more expensive and it takes a lot more time to do it it s very very difficult existing tools just aren t primed for doing those things that s where we come in with our experience with computer vision and graphics with our phds we re coming in to make this much easier for people to do lumenous has a plan on how they can help put this process within the capability of smaller companies or organizations we re developing hardware and software to make the whole process much easier for the designer and much more efficient said karsch and so instead of taking ten experienced people to create something like that one or two designers to could take a day to make something and set it up in just a few hours what we are trying to do is to revolutionize project mapping said jones instead of only being in high budget public events you ll see it in a more and more local retail experiences they are currently working on the beta version of their product which will include both hardware and software in their graduate work jones karsch and sodhi have been

entertainment continues to evolve but few innovations in the field have been more talked about in the last few months than microsoft s illumiroom project where cs graduate student brett jones is one of the principal researchers illumiroom is a proof of concept system that augments the area surrounding a television with peripheral projected illusions to enhance traditional gaming viewing experiences illumiroom is one of many major research projects microsoft research is presenting at this week s association for computer machinery acm sigchi special interest group on computer human interaction conference in paris france watch illumiroom peripheral projected illusions for interactive experiences video as outlined in the research paper illumiroom utilizes an ultra wide field of view projector and a kinect sensor that sits on a flat surface to create a virtual d model of your room the goal of the project is to virtually project an immersive experience out of the screen bringing the entire room into the experience according to illumiroom s research video those illusions could distort reality extend field of view and enable entirely new experiences such as those in gaming or film this could be done in several ways at the player s discretion for instance it could change the appearance of the room into a cartoon world or extend the content from the screen or just some of the elements into the room illumiroom can turn a forty inch tv into a fifteen foot tv so you can have a more immersive experience jones said what s more exciting and interesting is that you can mix virtual and physical things in your living room a process called augmented reality the experience no longer just exists in just your tv it exists in your living room as well brett jones the industry got its first look at illumiroom in january through a samsung keynote at the annual computer electronics show ces in las vegas since that time the technology industry has imagined how it could be applied and has generated a lot of social media discussion it s like running a user study with a couple of million people weighing in with ideas jones said tuesday jones and his collaborator hrvoje benko a researcher at microsoft research shared more details of the illumiroom project at the chi conference to read more visit http research microsoft com or download the full illumiroom paper illumiroom has created a lot of buzz and generated a discussion about what living room entertainment could look like in five years jones said the illumiroom project is designed to virtually project an immersive experience out of the screen bringing the entire room into the experience illumiroom automatically identifies where the television screen is and determines the color shape and dimensions of the items in your room it then uses a process called radiometric compensation to adjust the projection so it can work with the existing furniture in your room it can apply that information in many forms such as making it look like it s snowing with the snow accumulating on the furniture to do that it uses a real time physics simulation jones benko research manager andy wilson and senior researcher eyal ofek conceived the idea during a brainstorming session while jones was interning with microsoft research last summer all four principals had been involved in other projects involving projection space or as jones puts it the idea of taking your computer out of this little box that sits on your desk and making it interact with things in your environment jones worked on some early video prototypes of illumiroom getting feedback along the way and constantly added more to the system producing several iterations throughout the summer brett was instrumental in bringing illumiroom to life during his internship last summer benko said of jones involvement it was a super ambitious project for a twelve week internship and like most research projects at the beginning we had no idea whether it was going to work or not brett did a fabulous job incorporating different game engines into the experience and contributing to the camera projector calibration and real time effects pipeline although the research video mostly shows a first person shooter game experience the research team envisions how the concept could be applied to other genres like education and sports for instance jones said a designer could make a dora the explorer game where dora asks players to find a backpack somewhere else in the room applications could be used for sporting events on television where the scoreboard box that usually appears in the corner of the screen instead appears behind the television along with a twitter feed creating an even greater interactive encounter and allowing for the actual high definition screen to include just the video itself we were interested in this global concept shift where having this in your living room changes everything from playing a board game with your family to watching tv to enhancing your gaming experience jones said we also wanted to make it practical it needed to be easy to use for both the consumer and the designer a native of homewood illinois jones is now in his ninth year at illinois earning both bachelor s and master s degrees in computer science from the university he has been working under professor david forsyth in the area of computer vision and professor brian bailey in the area of human computer interaction hci each year microsoft research invites about phd level interns from

members were honored with faculty early career development career awards from the national science foundation matthew caesar julia hockenmaier and derek hoiem have each been honored with the agency s most prestigious awards given to young faculty matthew caesar matthew caesar proposes to design the first interactive debugging system for modern networked systems with his getting rid of bugs realizing interactive debugging of networked systems caesar takes the position that manual labor is a necessary evil of debugging problems in networked systems but believes that the system can be made vastly simpler with in network support for debugging illinois computer science professor matthew caesar the internet is the most complex distributed software infrastructure ever created says caesar it s this complexity that makes it particularly prone to bugs introduced by human error research to date on debugging the modern networked system has focused on automation according to caesar however the enormous complexity of such systems and their fundamental need for domain specific knowledge has rendered such approaches limited in practice leaving debugging a painstakingly manual process caesar will build on his previous work in network architecture and network failure diagnosis to develop new techniques and tools for interactive debugging on wan systems his work aims to make significant contributions to network architecture and protocol design by creating a new network layer substrate that allows for tight controls on network execution and extensions to support debugging in untrusted environments caesar explains the need for his systems by pointing out that network and service providers today spend billions hiring armies of skilled developers and troubleshooters networks that can be rapidly repaired after exceptions are an essential component of disaster survival and recovery for business and communication systems and it can accelerate deployment of networks in underdeveloped regions lacking experienced technicians julia hockenmaier julia hockenmaier is focusing on the task of statistical parsing or finding the most likely grammatical analysis of a sentence with her bayesian models for lexicalized grammars hockenmaier s approach is based on a combination of computational and linguistic expertise that she sees as key to long term success in the field of natural language processing illinois computer science professor julia hockenmaier although nlp applications are a part of our everyday lives with grammar checkers in word processing applications dialog and speech recognition systems in customer service hotlines and translation systems provided by search engines we are far from having accurate nlp systems for a wide range of domains says hockenmaier hockenmaier s work promises to overcome some of the fundamental limitations of current approaches by advancing nlp through the application of machine learning to linguistically motivated representations in particular we argue that the preceding linguistic context in which an utterance occurs provides information that can help us better know which interpretation is correct explains hockenmaier models such as mine which take this context into account promise to be less dependent on training data and thus significantly better at adapting to new domains and instances in the long term hockenmaier s work could provide the foundation for language models that prefer grammatical sentences that forma coherent text enabling better speech recognition and machine translation derek hoiem derek hoiem s work in large scale recognition using shared structures flexible learning and efficient search aims to enable computers to interpret objects in images illinois computer science professor derek hoiem by developing algorithms to recognize parts materials pose and other properties of objects hoiem aims to give computers the ability to make predictions about new objects that they encounter humans have an amazing ability to look at an object and identify its parts materials pose and other attributes even if the object is not familiar explains hoiem such abilities enable us to respond appropriately to unexpected events such as when a child with a tricycle rolls out onto the road computers have the potential to prevent automobile accidents or relieve us of mundane household chores but these applications require algorithms that can respond appropriately to new objects due to recent advances in pattern recognition computers can assign objects into one of a pre defined set of categories but each new object must be learned separately and hoiem adds computers are at a complete loss when faced with an unfamiliar object in our view large scale recognition is a problem of designing object representations that enable new objects to be understood in terms of existing ones to do this hoiem will design structure representations that share appearance and spatial layout models across related categories structured models will be learned from detailed annotations in the core image dataset that hoiem and his colleagues created for example when learning from examples of cats the computer would learn to predict the locations of the head legs tail and to identify the pose as well as to find cats in new images then upon seeing a dog for the first time the computer could identify the dog as some kind of animal and find its head and legs even if the name dog is not yet known according to hoiem major technical challenges include developing efficient methods for identifying objects creating methods to incrementally learn about new objects and finding effective ways of learning from a mixture of loose and detailed annotations ultimately hoiem hopes that his work will lead to visual object recognition algorithms that are more detailed flexible and accurate with applications in vehicle safety security assistive technologies household robotics and

corporate partners about us faculty positions staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news illinois researchers building first autonomous vision based robotic system for monitoring construction projects by mike koon college of engineering wed anyone who has been involved with a construction project understands that because tight deadlines are a norm staying on schedule becomes imperative for grander projects completion even days late can be costly both in terms of construction costs and lost revenue with that in mind a group of university of illinois professors is developing a first of its kind automated vision based construction progress monitoring system which uses video and still images taken with the aid of a robotic quadcopter the aerial robotic device would autonomously transport recording equipment to strategic points along a job site eventually returning to a home base the video and images would be downloaded and the operations on the site analyzed giving project managers a more accurate status of current construction progress together with a comparison to the project plan this improves project management team s understanding of when actual or potential construction progress deviations happen the robotic quadcopter also autonomously mounts and demounts a network of video cameras to building elements on the site to record dynamic construction operations from strategic locations and viewpoints from these video streams new computer vision methods will detect track and analyze activities of the construction equipment and craft workers in d to provide an accurate and direct measurement of productivity on the site and enable root cause assessment on performance deviations by providing a visual interface to the outcome of monitoring operations the system improves decision makings that can lead to efficiency in execution of the project the project called flying superintendents joins the expertise of lead principal investigator mani golparvar fard from civil and environmental engineering with co pis derek hoiem from computer science and tim bretl from aerospace engineering the team successfully received a nearly million cyber physical systems cps award through the national science foundation for the project which kicked off in january and continues through the end of the group has started preliminary studies at two locations one on the illinois campus at the construction site of residence hall on the ikenberry commons and another at one of the largest current stadium projects in the country the new million home for the nba s sacramento kings because of some early seed funding from the national center for supercomputing applications ncsa initial data collection has already begun watch video taken from quadcopter bretl s research group is building the robotic quadcopters and its operating system which controls the autonomous data collection process these robotic quadcopters also magnetically dock the video cameras at various places through an autonomous operation allowing for video recording of the site operations hoiem is among other things taking these images and videos to automatically analyze the changes on construction site and assess activities of the craft workers in d d time golparvar fard meanwhile is creating methods that can automatically compare the site image based d models with pre produced renderings of the expected progress and color code them in red or green to indicate parts of the job that are either at ahead or behind schedule he is also translating the outcome of the video based activity analysis into workface assessment that could be used for root cause analysis of performance deviations members of the autonomous vision based robotic system project include front row l r kevin han jacob lin joseph degol and ka wai tsoi back row l r xinke deng tim bretl derek hoiem mani golparvar fard nour dabboussi joseph yaw darko akyeampong rebecca nothof and david hanley according to golparvar fard these methods track performance at project and operation levels and can drastically improve assessment time and accuracy this means that project managers superintendents and field engineers would not need to traverse the job site regularly to make their assessments which are often subjective and take many hours to days to complete quickly detecting potential or actual problems helps projects stay on schedule golparvar fard said because the robots fly daily and because the network of cameras can be frequently installed this method can provide a d d time model of the construction at both project and task levels this rich multi level model provides a way for quick qualitative and quantitate analysis showing deviation in terms of budgeted cost on a daily basis the second part of the project involves activity analysis applying hoeim s computer vision techniques the system will capture tasks of workers and relate them to productivity the goal is to install fixed cameras throughout the site with the capability to detect and track each worker once they are detected they can be tracked in d with use of the other cameras throughout the site the robot would transport each camera autonomously there are many reasons why these projects fall behind schedule golparvar fard explains in order to detect why they are behind contractors have to look into both equipment and workers we can tell you what percent of the time each worker spends on productive tasks how much was spent walking to and from tasks and how much was spent simply waiting the superintendents then can use the information to perhaps change roles tools or sequence of tasks for increased efficiency media contacts media inquiries may be

sciences center fri researchers at the advanced digital sciences center specializing in computer vision technologies are developing an intuitive reliable and fast solution for identifying and retrieving relevant information about pill medications applications for the pill identification technology include use in hospital and nursing home pill packing machines as well as a mobile device for patients specifically the elderly to ensure the right pills are being taken each day in hospitals pills are automatically packaged by machines but mistakes often lead to manual quality control adsc s algorithm would improve pill identification accuracy ensuring that the correct patient receives the correct medication each day many of today s hospitals currently have pill packing machines which automatically package the pills for each patient some of these machines include quality control modules to check for physical defects of pills gaps in package seal correct and readable labels and quantity errors using technology such as barcodes and radio frequency identification rfid however in many machines these techniques are inaccurate or outdated often leading to time consuming manual quality control adsc s pill identification research is led by computer science alumnus gang wang phd a research scientist at adsc it was inspired by a conversation about personal pill containers between adsc director marianne winslett and adsc research scientist jiangbo lu who helped initiate the research adsc s pill identification algorithm complements pill packing machines such as the one shown here by automating the inspection of pill packets according to wang adsc s technology works directly on pill images using image processing and computer vision techniques first given an input image the pill part is automatically separated from the background then different techniques are applied to detect and represent key visual features of the pill including major colors shape and imprint finally a two step image matching approach is performed to retrieve the top matched pills from an online image database based on the similarity of visual features pill packers wang and his team have been collaborating with singapore s national university hospital to develop a final product in a testing lab wang is using the algorithm created at adsc to complement the current pill packing machines the hospital already has the hospital s machines have been programmed with the new algorithm so the machines are able to automatically detect anything incorrect in the packing in developing the algorithm wang and his team faced many challenges such as low quality images of pills due to reflections on bag surface and pills with similar shapes textures or colors additionally when there are multiple pills in a bag some may be occluded or identical pills may have different orientations we have addressed the imaging and orientation issues but we are still working on how to tell small differences between the pills or the verification accuracy wang said ideally the team believes that every hospital in the world would benefit from this technology in addition they plan to also push the mobile version of their pill identification technology as it will most benefit the aging population aging has become a very big problem so we re seeing more and more senior citizens staying home without other relatives or healthcare providers wang said they have to take care of themselves and often have to take a lot of pills every day our staff can integrate our algorithm with the proper hardware and we can help them make sure they take the right pills each day wang and his team plan to commercialize the application for use in hospitals to complement pill packaging machines in the near future they are also looking to create a prototype this summer and expect to integrate the algorithm with the hardware later in the advanced digital sciences center is a singapore based

protected their first trade secrets finalized the first license for adsc technology created the first demonstrations of several new technologies and received two new faculty appointments all while having over papers accepted at various conferences and journals we made enormous progress in which was adsc s second full year of operation advanced digital sciences center director and illinois computer science professor marianne winslett said i m really proud of the great work that our young people are doing and it s been a joy to see them blossom here from our interns to our research scientists we ve got a fantastic staff and that s why we ve done so well adsc s research portfolio includes eight research projects in interactive digital media three on the smart grid and two independent projects the areas of research vary from hardware synthesis and video tracking to radio networks and biomedical research the year began with researchers demonstrating their work to the upper management of singapore s agency for science technology and research a star it was the first time many of the technologies such as arise entity search video cut out and finding of the directions of sound in d which has since been made d had been demonstrated in public for many areas of computer science seeing is believing winslett said for example if you watch our demo of background removal in live video you very quickly understand what the research is about and literally see the contribution adsc can now offer at least nine demonstrations of its research results many of which can be seen in adsc s research highlights and application highlights series in may computer science affiliate professor deming chen ece and adsc researcher eric liang among others were awarded adsc s first best paper prize at the ieee symposium on field programmable custom computing machines fccm their paper multilevel granularity parallelism synthesis on fpgas addressed the difficulty and slow turnaround time for producing a hardware implementation of a software algorithm traditionally the fastest approach is for the software developers to work with a hardware developer who can produce a design for a field programmable gate array fpga an integrated circuit that can be customized after its manufacture chen and liang s research seeks to eliminate the need for a hardware developer while also cutting the design cycle from approximately six months to just a couple of weeks their award winning paper showed how to take programs written in cuda a c like language that is already popular among software developers for programming gpus and compile the program into a good quality fpga design we re happy that the collaboration between adsc and us was very fruitful chen said the best paper award is recognition from the community showing we have done research with impact and with high quality results chen hopes this is just the beginning and that further research will lead to commercialization opportunities that will bring real technology benefits in singapore and beyond chen along with illinois electrical and computer engineering professor minh do and adsc researchers kyle rupnow liang yinan li and dongbo min were also nominated for a best paper award at the december ieee international conference on field programmable technology for their paper entitled high level synthesis of stereo matching productivity performance and software constraints it s a humbling experience because both conferences are very competitive chen said both are considered top conferences in the field so winning one award and being nominated again within this short period of time during the first year of the project is very exciting one of adsc s goals is to turn fundamental research into real world applications in adsc had its first vision research protected as a trade secret by exploit technologies the commercialization arm of a star adsc researchers are also involved with two singaporean companies that are commercializing research results from adsc and illinois this shows that it s possible to do basic research that has an impact in the real world winslett said even though it s fundamental research it s close enough to the real world to have immediate application winslett added that adsc works to take advantage of the unique opportunities singapore has for startup companies and that adsc encourages the scholar entrepreneur model that is popular at top u s academic institutions adsc helps bring these novel technologies into singapore and the center offers a platform for people in illinois and singapore to get together and make contributions chen said through effective collaboration the center is pushing for technology transfer publishing high quality

university of illinois computer science professor marianne winslett is leading a new project that will eliminate significant privacy risks that currently impede researchers ability to analyze biomedical data about individuals immense amounts of valuable data now exist that are unusable by the research community due to the lack of an effective method for concealing individuals identities the project is taking place at the advanced digital sciences center adsc and is funded by a star the new adsc work will generate new publication schemes for the results of data analyses thus making detailed summaries of health data available that can offer unprecedented insight into a vast range of medical conditions and provide useful input for urban planners public health officials and researchers university of illniois computer science professor marianne winslett the s million project which is entitled enabling mining of medical records through differential privacy is led by adsc director prof marianne winslett her co principal investigators include prof xiaokui xiao of nanyang technological university prof jiawei han of the department of computer science at the university of illinois at urbana champaign dr see kiong ng of the institute for infocomm research and prof nikita borisov of the department of electrical computer engineering at illinois the team also includes biomedical researchers dr e shyong tai from the national university of singapore and dr edison liu from the genome institute of singapore the widespread availability of biomedical data ranging from reports of the locations of new cases of dengue fever to individuals genomic variations appears to offer researchers a tremendous opportunity statistical analysis of such data can help researchers and public health officials better understand a disease and its transmission patterns gain new insights into the human body and develop new treatments and services that can improve the quality of life of millions of people unfortunately privacy concerns make it infeasible to provide researchers with unlimited access to biomedical information previous attempts to solve this problem have tried to anonymize data by removing personally identifiable information from medical records but this does not provide sufficient protection the main problem is that external knowledge can be used to re identify individuals whose data appear in supposedly anonymized data sets many ideas for mitigating the problem have been proposed but all of them have made the unrealistic assumption that adversaries had limited prior knowledge in fact this has been shown to be a fundamental barrier explains winslett an anonymized database will either reveal private information given certain external knowledge or will be useless for answering some questions to the extent that databases of patient information have already been made available they have made many lifesaving discoveries possible for example a university of san antonio study involving data collected from over breast cancer patients showed that amplification of the her oncogene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer this information subsequently led to the development of herceptin trastuzumab a targeted therapy that is effective for many women with her positive breast cancer likewise it was medical records research that led to the discovery that supplementing folic acid during pregnancy can prevent neural tube birth defects ntds and population based surveillance systems later showed that the number of ntds decreased percent after mandatory fortification of cereal grain food products no one doubts that additional valuable findings would follow if a way to tackle the privacy limitations can be found so that far more patient data can be made available to researchers to that end medical studies funded by the national institutes of health nih in the u s are required to make the data they collect as well as summaries of analysis results available to other researchers originally the statistical summaries were freely available to other researchers via nih s dbgap database http www ncbi nlm nih gov gap while access to the detailed patient records required researchers to undergo a rigorous and fairly arduous approval process with their institutional review boards irbs privacy concerns subsequently led nih to restrict dbgap access so that today many of the statistical summaries cannot be viewed without irb approval the need for irb approval is a significant hurdle for researchers who want to access the summary statistics from old studies to help them plan their future work to find a practical solution the adsc team is using the recently developed concept of differential privacy differential privacy works by adding a small amount of noise to the results of statistical analyses of sensitive data sets under differential privacy the contributions of any one individual s data towards the outcome of an analysis are negligible analysis results will be essentially identical regardless of whether a particular person s data are included this should not limit the usefulness of the results since in a large and well designed medical study the history of a single individual should not have a significant impact on overall results when analysis of a data set begins its owners decide on a total privacy budget for the entire data set each published analysis result uses up a little bit of the privacy budget and once the budget has been exhausted no more results can be published as they could open the possibility of at least one individual s data having a non negligible impact on overall results differential privacy offers us the tantalizing possibility of being able to do privacy preserving data analysis that is both useful and secure says winslett it s such a new

by a tap of the break when it was actually dormant said cs professor alex kirlik automation has become an integral part of people s lives and it is often taken for granted however there are instances when automation needs to have a human step in such as a car speeding up an exit ramp alex kirlik led by cs professor alex kirlik illinois researchers have received a national science foundation nsf grant to study cyber physical human systems to further investigate how humans need to be added to the equation of automation for many aspects of our lives this project brings together researchers from computing and engineering disciplines to study ways to create validate and demonstrate the value of new techniques for ensuring that systems composed of combinations of hardware software and humans can operate in a synergistic and safe fashion the researchers will look at ways to improve the interactions of the cyber and physical systems cyber physical systems are those in which there is hardware with embedded software for sensing monitoring and systems control an example would the inclusion of sensors and computing systems into the structure of bridges to provide a continuing monitoring of the bridges strength and safety increasingly these types of systems are used within areas where humans find themselves interacting our goal is to design systems that outperform what may be possible by either automation or by unaided humans alone kirlik said you make automation and humans team players that can then perform better than either of them operating individually for this study the researchers are going to be looking at aviation and anesthesiology as areas where today the cyber physical systems also interact closely with humans we will develop an integrated framework for the design and evaluation of what we call cyber physical human systems or cph systems kirlik said the team will focus on the areas of flight simulation and anesthesiology in aviation automation of flight control has been increasing as airplanes and flight technology have become increasingly complex the calculations and adjustments made by these machines are at the level that could not be made by humans alone nevertheless said kirlik no engineer could foresee a double bird strike after taking off from laguardia airport that would require landing the airplane in the hudson river we don t have not only do we not have the adaptive control automation but the artificial intelligence yet to be able to make the types of real time seat of the pants judgment that that pilot was able to make in the example kirlik gave of captain sullenberger who landed the us airways plane on the hudson river it was essential that a human step in it is these instances that kirlik and his team will investigate we are interested in this class of systems where there s hardware software yet still a human in the loop he said kirlik and his team want to investigate the cyber physical human aspects of both flight flight and anesthesiology like flight anesthesiology is a highly automated field but there are times when it is essential that the human step in to maintain patient safety in anesthesiology we will have a similar need to design interfaces to these drug delivery systems that give the anesthesiologist a very good picture as to what these automated systems are doing kirlik said the ultimate goal of the entire project is to develop cph systems where safety and performance exceed what could be achieved with either skilled humans or with automation alone in addition to

received the award in cs professor vikram adve was one of the recipients of the acm software system award for work on llvm one of the other recipients was cs alumnus chris lattner according to an acm press release the researchers were recognized in particular for designing and implementing llvm which is noted for the openness of its technology and the quality of its architecture and engineering as well as its clean flexible design and easy to use programming interfaces lattner and adve began working on llvm in at the time said adve there was a dichotomy in compilers some compilers worked with static languages such as c c and fortran you basically compile them ahead of time to machine code he said and then once you get machine code you leave it the way it is you don t do much with it other compilers worked on managed languages such as java and c and were able to do analyses and transformations while a program is running these were the so called just in time compilers you never could use these run time techniques on static languages or do any static techniques on managed languages said adve adve believes this was perhaps the major technical innovation of llvm the ability to apply either ahead of time or run time techniques with any of these languages llvm was released to the public in october as an open source compiler infrastructure in less than ten years it has had a major impact llvm is now the primary compiler used in all apple products as well as in products from many other large and small technology companies ranging from ios and android mobile devices to cray supercomputers including blue waters the new petaflop scale system at the university of illinois llvm has also seen widespread and rapidly growing adoption for software research in areas as diverse as architecture compilers software security formal verification and silicon compilation among many others i think there are two reasons why llvm has become so popular said adve one is the innovative design which has enabled a wide range of compile time link time and run time compiler products for a wide variety of programming languages the second reason is that it s a very well designed well engineered software system adve gives much of the credit for the software design in particular to lattner chris is a phenomenal programmer and system designer he said he is single handedly responsible for the elegance and cleanliness of the llvm architecture as well as much of the code in spite of these advantageous features adve had no idea that llvm would turn out to be as popular as it has i think our best hopes would have been that it would be used by a few companies and used somewhat more widely in the research community where having a more modern and easier to use infrastructure makes a big difference said adve but they did not expect it to become a primary compiler at companies as large as apple qualcomm nvidia and cray that is a very big deal explained adve the compiler is a lynchpin piece of software all kinds of tools in the tool chain get affected when you change the compiler such as debuggers linkers performance analysis tools and interactive development environments he said replacing the compiler system is a much deeper change than you could imagine especially for a major company with a large portfolio of software tools adve has recently begun investigating new directions for llvm he is now using it in a project on heterogeneous parallel computing such as would be needed to make full use of the application processors in modern smartphones and tablets llvm gives us an interesting foundation for that research he said we are basically trying to extend llvm to provide an explicitly parallel virtual instruction set abstraction for heterogeneous parallel systems over the course of his career adve has won numerous awards for his research including the audience choice paper award at the acm symposium on operating systems principles the best paper award at the acm sigplan conference on programming language design and implementation jointly with chris lattner for a key part of lattner s phd dissertation the c w gear outstanding junior faculty award

research afosr and the university of illinois at urbana champaign the center will be lead by university of illinois computer science professor roy campbell the assured cloud computing acc center which will be housed in the university s information trust institute iti will perform research provide technical exchange and educate professionals and students in the secure cloud computing sciences and technologies that are needed to allow the air force to succeed in air space and cyberspace missions acc s research activities will focus on developing technology for assured mission critical cloud computing across blue and or gray networks that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data and communications job completion in the presence of cyber attacks and failures and timely completion of jobs to meet mission requirements the principal investigator for the acc center will be dr roy campbell who is the sohaib and sara abbasi professor in the department of computer science cs at illinois illinois computer science professor roy campbell will lead the million center cloud computing is computing in which a user accesses a shared heterogeneous set of computing resources without necessarily having information on the configuration location or identity of those resources a computational cloud used in military applications may include both blue and gray networks where blue networks are u s military networks which are considered secure and gray networks are those in private hands or perhaps belonging to other nations which are considered insecure in order to reach mission goals it will sometimes be necessary to coordinate computation across a mixture of these blue and gray resources thus cloud computing in a military context presents special security challenges specifically assured mission critical cloud computing across blue and or gray networks requires the realization of end to end and cross layered security dependability and timeliness we re trying to offer the military extended functionality to implement a vision of global vigilance global reach and global power giving us the ability to meet overseas commitments explains campbell if we can use a variety of secure networks plus insecure networks it gives us lots of agility and mobility and the ability to manage situations where normally we wouldn t be able to reach he points to humanitarian missions in potentially unfriendly territory as an example application suppose you have a rescue mission say a disaster in pakistan like an earthquake or a river flooding if their government requests help do we have the capabilities to safely assist in their aid not all the people in pakistan might agree with the u s providing assistance staging such an operation would be risky without a cloud infrastructure that has secure properties so how do you assure a successful mission in a possibly hostile environment how do you benefit from the cloud its communication computations and data in missions to help people in need ilesanmi adesida the dean of the college of engineering at illinois observed that the planned research has broad implications although the new project will primarily

illinois computer scientists and civil engineers have been working to develop an inexpensive system for continuous and reliable structural health monitoring shm to help protect the estimated trillion civil infrastructure in the us computer science professor gul agha and civil and environmental engineering professor billie f spencer lead the project cs professor gul agha the team has successfully deployed their system this summer at full scale on the new jindo bridge in south korea as part of a trilateral collaboration between the university of illinois the university of tokyo and the korean advanced institute of science and technology the deployment is the largest of its kind for civil infrastructure to date and is the first dense deployment of a wireless sensor network on a cable stayed bridge the project demonstrates the suitability of the illinois approach and the illinois developed software for full scale continuous autonomous structural health monitoring according to government data annual infrastructure costs amount to between of the gdp for most industrialized nations with recent bridge collapses in the us much attention has been focused on the declining state of the aging and poorly monitored bridges and roads the ability to continuously monitor the integrity of civil infrastructure in real time offers the opportunity to reduce maintenance and inspection costs while providing increased safety to the public manual inspection of bridges costs millions of dollars is relatively unreliable and can only be carried out infrequently some real world deployments show that dense arrays of sensors can provide detailed information about the state of civil infrastructure said illinois civil engineering professor billie f spencer however the enormous expense of installing traditional monitoring systems has significantly limited deployment to address this issue the illinois team is testing a system that employs dense arrays of wireless smart sensors designed to record and transmit complex high fidelity data cheaply and efficiently the team s technology employs concurrent and distributed real time processing to overcome the limitations inherent in traditional centralized approaches the collaboration has resulted in new hardware and software systems for the continuous and reliable monitoring of civil infrastructure with the most recent release of an open source toolsuite containing a library of services for and examples of shm applications illinois computer scientists working on the project have led the development of a service oriented architecture soa that lends itself to further expansion customization and development of applications for shm it provides complete applications that facilitate common tasks throughout the design testing deployment and monitoring of the shm system while utilities offer a set of basic testing and debugging commands to be included with existing applications the shm services toolsuite includes utilities for resetting nodes remotely listing the nodes within communication range of the local node testing radio communication performance and changing the radio channel and power for local and remote nodes the illinois civil engineers have developed specialized hardware to accurately detect high frequency vibrations and strain in structures the hardware plugs into embedded computers and works in conjunction with the soa for shm the traditional centralized approach for shm is not feasible with moderate to large numbers of sensors tremendous amounts of data must be sent to such a central station requiring expensive difficult to install wired networking and introducing a single point of failure said illinois computer science professor gul agha the lead cs collaborator on the project our research in distributed shm using wireless sensor networks overcomes these problems and promises a robust significantly lower cost safer alternative to traditional structure inspection techniques in combination the illinois developed system of sensors and software create an integrated framework that can easily be utilized by most civil engineers without requiring an extensive background in computer science

university of illinois at urbana champaign will receive an initial million in grant funds from the u s national security agency nsa to stimulate the creation of a more scientific basis for the design and analysis of trusted systems it is widely understood that critical cyber systems must inspire trust and confidence protect the privacy and integrity of data resources and perform reliably to tackle the ongoing challenges of securing tomorrow s systems the nsa concluded that a collaborative community of researchers from government industry and academia is a must illinois computer science professor jose meseguer to that end the nsa grant will seed an academic lablet focused on the development of a science of security sos and a broad self sustaining community effort to advance it a major goal is the creation of a unified body of knowledge that can serve as the basis of a trust engineering discipline curriculum and rigorous design methodologies the results of sos lablet research are to be extensively documented and widely distributed through the use of a new network based collaboration environment the intention is for that environment to be the primary resource for learning about ongoing work in security science and to be a place to participate with others in advancing the state of the art the illinois lablet which will be housed in the information trust institute at illinois will contribute broadly to the development of security science while leveraging illinois expertise in resiliency which in this context means a system s demonstrable ability to maintain security properties even during ongoing cyber attacks david m nicol the illinois lablet s principal investigator explains the complexity of software systems guarantees that there will almost always be errors that can be exploited by attackers we have a critical need for foundational design principles that anticipate penetrations contain them and limit their effects even if the penetration isn t detected the lablet s work will draw on several fundamental areas of computing research some ideas from fault tolerant computing can be adapted to the context of security strategies from control theory will be extended to account for the high variation and uncertainty that may be present in systems when they are under attack game theory and decision theory principles will be used to explore the interplay between attack and defense formal methods will be applied to develop formal notions of resiliency end to end system analysis will be employed to investigate resiliency of large systems against cyber attack the lablet s work will draw upon ideas from other areas of mathematics and engineering as well nicol the project s principal investigator is a professor of electrical and computer

professor andreas kloeckner brings an expertise in high performance scientific computing and the numerical solution of partial differential equations to the department he joins the cs department from courant institute at new york university where he was a courant instructor he received his phd from brown university in most of my work has involved computer simulations of complicated wave problems he said these occur in many engineering applications ranging from fluid flow and weather prediction to simulations of electromagnetic interference in support of his research kloeckner has released numerous open source software packages some of which have grown to have large and thriving user bases his software interests are centered around resolving the perceived conflict between high performance and human friendly abstract code using run time code generation and code transformation techniques this semester kloeckner is teaching cs ak integral equations and fast algorithms integral equations enable extremely efficient solution algorithms for a large and important class of simulation problems with recent developments which i will be discussing in the class these approaches are becoming more broadly applicable and easier to use said kloeckner as one may expect a lot of kloeckner s work involves a heavy dose of mathematics in fact he was in the math department while at courant as he explains lines become blurred in the area of his research interest there s always a math component there s always a cs component and there s always an application component he said and i think that s fantastic the inherently interdisciplinary nature of my work means that there s a great variety of interesting things to work on drawn from computation mathematics and the application area it certainly keeps life interesting kloeckner particularly looks forward to working in a strong engineering college at illinois my work is in numerical mathematical methods that on their own are not terribly useful until they are connected to an application he said engineering is very strong here and there are many possible applications of my work each providing a potential opportunity for having an impact on numerical and engineering practice tao xie originally from china cs associate professor tao xie received his phd in computer science from the university of washington in seattle in

his research group to continue work on tool automation for improving software dependability he received an nsf career award in to study cooperative testing and analysis how to enable tools and users to cooperate for better accomplishing the ultimate goal this involved bringing human factors into the process of tool automation we want to engage software engineers the typical users of our software engineering tools to work with the tools to produce better results such as better effectiveness of software testing and analysis said xie another research focus would be on extending the scope of dependability attributes targeted by his research while previous research has focused on functional correctness or robustness whether a software system crashes or not xie would like to expand the focus to attributes such as performance and security along with their impact on dependability by collaborating with other engineering faculty members from diverse fields xie had a vibrant research group at nc state and several of his students will be following him to illinois some will transfer to the university s graduate program and some will complete their education as nc state students who are visiting students at illinois this fall xie is teaching cs topics in software engineering he is working with other faculty members to look at ways to include software testing topics into existing

to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news building the future internet fri forty years ago no one could have predicted the evolution of the internet when first created the internet was designed to connect machines mainly supercomputers with one another after all there were only a few and who other than a few scientists would need networked computers and so the internet protocol ip made the machines first class citizens allowing them to find and talk to one another but of course the internet has far exceeded initial expectations in ways that no one could have expected in so doing it has stretched initial assumptions and its original communication model could no longer be up to the task rather than finding individual machines today s internet users are interested in finding content this fundamental change is making it increasingly inefficient to conform to ip s requirement to discover and specify machine addresses when what the user really wants is pieces of information to carry the internet into the future a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required from today s focus on where addresses and hosts to a focus on what the content that users and applications care about and a team of illinois researchers led by computer science professor tarek abdelzaher will be working to make that transformational shift happen abdelzaher and his team will be working with researchers from ucla and other institutions as part of a million grant led by lixia zhang at ucla to create a new internet architecture called named data networking ndn the chief architect of the overall project is van jacobson one of the internet pioneers credited for great advances in tcp ip who has had the vision of ndn for some time illinois computer science professor tarek abdelzaher according to the team ndn capitalizes on strengths and addresses weaknesses of the internet s current host based point to point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication not well supported by today s internet the project studies a set of problems necessary to validate ndn as a future internet architecture routing scalability fast forwarding efficiency of signature generation and verification trust models network security and defense content protection and privacy and fundamental communication theory abdelzaher and his team in collaboration with ucla will lead application development for the future internet the illinois team will demonstrate how the named data networking paradigm can significantly simplify development of such applications and improve their efficiency and automation as well as help make them more reliable and trusted in the process abdelzaher hopes to discover new insights that improve the underlying architecture of the named data networking paradigm itself since the amount of information that sensors and other modern technology generates and stores grows exponentially whereas our ability to comprehend and consume it does not future applications will be centered increasingly around some notion of information distillation that is to say bridging the growing gap between the increasing amounts of raw data on one end and the human need for succinct actionable information on the other explains abdelzaher a willet faculty scholar one can think of web browsing as one example of a rather poorly automated and inefficient form of information distillation where humans look for useful information in a sea of possibly irrelevant data the new paradigm has the potential to significantly improve internet performance and greatly simplify authoring and dissemination of future information centric internet applications including cloud computing applications sensing applications and smart spaces where data is the first class citizen as our reliance on a secure and highly dependable information technology infrastructure continues to increase it is no longer clear that emerging and future needs of our society can be met by the current trajectory of incremental changes to the current internet said ty znati director of the computer and

the rise many drivers may be asking themselves is there a way to decrease the amount of fuel my car is consuming prof tarek abdelzaher the relationship between fuel consumption and driving routes is an area of interest for many scientific researchers around the world at the illinois department of computer science professor tarek abdelzaher and his phd students raghu kiran ganti hossein ahmadi and pham nam are taking an interesting approach tackling the problem using sensors and gps the team is developing a novel navigation service called green gps to solve this real world problem and help drivers make more informed fuel saving decisions green gps maps vehicular fuel consumption on city streets allowing drivers to find the most fuel efficient routes for their vehicles between arbitrary end points green gps relies on data collected by individuals from their vehicles as well as on mathematical models that are developed in abdelzaher s lab to compute fuel efficient routes unlike existing internet services such as google maps and mapquest which provide either the fastest or the shortest route between two points explains ganti green gps collects the necessary information to compute and answer queries on the most fuel efficient route the most fuel efficient route between two points may be different from the shortest and fastest routes for example a fast route that uses a freeway may consume more fuel because fuel consumption increases non linearly with speed or because the route is longer similarly the shortest route that traverses busy city streets may be suboptimal because of downtown traffic the optimal route might therefore be neither shortest nor fastest the service exploits measurements of standard vehicular sensor interfaces that give access to most gauges and engine instrumentation vehicles that have been sold in the united states after are mandatorily equipped with a sensing subsystem called the on board diagnostic obd ii system the obd ii is a diagnostic system that monitors the health of the automobile using sensors that measure approximately different engine parameters examples of monitored measurements include fuel consumption engine rpm coolant temperature and vehicle speed to build its fuel efficiency models green gps utilizes a vehicle s obd ii system and a typical scanner tool in conjunction with a participatory sensing framework the team is collecting data from vehicles driven by research participants to determine what factors influence fuel consumption the data collected by the participants is driving the creation of a mathematical model that the researchers say will enabled green gps to estimate fuel consumption for different streets and car types for which no direct obd ii measurements are present you do not have to be a member of our service or install any sensors in your car to be able to use green gps suggests abdelzaher our models predict what your car will consume all you need to do is type in a source and a destination address on a webpage as well as the make model and year of your vehicle of course you can choose to be a member too and upload data from your vehicle using our software in which case our estimates for your car will be more accurate the service will soon be available on handheld gps devices this study will help better understand factors that contribute most to the fuel efficiency of vehicles in everyday use street congestion elevation variability average speed and average distance between stops e g stop signs may lead to changes in the amount of fuel consumed factors may also include vehicle make and model and an individual s driving style a parent who drives their car with smoother transitions between vehicle speeds might end up spending less gas on the same route than for instance their year old child who guns the engine says abdelzaher abdelzaher and his students are enthusiastic about the results of their work so far early studies have already shown a reduction in consumer gas consumption with limited data they said and they hope to see even greater results with more data and detailed analysis yet to come going forward professor abdelzaher and his team plan

wants to make the internet faster members of the speed of light research team from left brighten godfrey ankit singla balakrishnan chandrasekaran phd student duke university and bruce maggs pelham wilder professor of computer science duke university does that just mean more and more bandwidth it turns out that s only part of the story when people and machines interact across the network even sending a small message and getting a reply can take significant time that is what s called network latency latency is the key challenge for our interactive experiences on the internet whether between people or computers godfrey said and today every millisecond matters he calls his project networking at the speed of light godfrey is proposing a mission for the computer networking research community as a whole to strive to attain an internet with as close as possible to speed of light latency which is the ultimate physical limit of network speed some of the largest web players like google amazon and bing have studied how much latency matters by artificially inserting delays for a small random sample of their users these studies showed that even seemingly insignificant increases in latency have a real impact on how people interact with the technology people decrease their interactions markedly when latency is increased often responding to delays of a fraction of a second when browsing the web low latency is also critical for playing an online game or conversing with audio or video a speed of light internet could have a more transformational effect on how we use the medium humans perceive visual events within about milliseconds as indistinguishable said cs phd candidate ankit singla who leads internet wide measurement work on the project if we can push latencies down that low this effectively instant response would be an important threshold in user experience what s more improvements in latency compound quickly the earth s surface is two dimensional so as we shrink internet latency the physical area we can reach within a certain time limit grows quadratically godfrey said this means even a modest improvement in latency can lead to connecting dramatically more people with very low latency such online communities are crucial for applications like gaming interactive music performance and telepresence this might just allow some new applications to hit critical mass godfrey said the first stage of the project which is a collaboration with balakrishnan chandrasekaran and bruce maggs of duke university is to understand the state of the internet today despite the importance of latency singla s measurements have found that even simple operations like downloading the first small piece of a web page are commonly a factor of slower than the speed of light and often times slower that means that even a small communication with a distant server might easily take seconds when the server could be reached in a few tens of milliseconds the team s task is to examine the causes of the latency that is where does the time go why is the internet actually so slow compared to what it could be singla said that involves a measurement of factors at every layer of the internet all the way from where the fiber lines and the routers are physically located to business policies of isps that can direct packets along circuitous routes to protocols that are used to transfer data to delays in the cloud servers and applications fully end to end let s understand the problem of where the time goes with the measurement work serving as a guide godfrey s research group is also developing new technology to reduce latency in some of the internet s most important protocols one of the hardest problems is dealing gracefully with the many unusual conditions that occur in the internet which can cause high variability in latency we can actually use that response time variability to our advantage godfrey explained by sending the same request to many different servers simultaneously and using the first answer that comes back cs phd student ashish vulimiri developed this technique using it to halve dns resolution time a key step in loading a web page vulimiri

to the university of illinois to help put those concerns to rest illinois computer science professor carl gunter will lead the million sharps center for health information privacy and security faculty from the computer science department at the university of illinois are set to lead a multi university consortium of researchers who intend to make the technologies involved in electronic health records health information exchange and telemedicine trustworthy enough to earn the confidence of doctors and patients the ultimate goal of the project is to improve patient outcomes while limiting inappropriate access the project will be based at the information trust institute iti at illinois the research award entitled strategic healthcare information technology advanced research projects on security sharps will result in the creation of the sharps center for health information privacy and security within iti and will support research led by senior researchers at the university of illinois the university of california at berkeley carnegie mellon university dartmouth college harvard medical school johns hopkins university new york university northwestern memorial hospital stanford university the university of massachusetts amherst the university of washington and vanderbilt university the sharps program s lead investigator computer science professor and iti researcher carl a gunter explained the program s motivation it is essential for patients and healthcare providers to have confidence in the information technologies on which modern healthcare is becoming increasingly reliant sharps will address a key range of security and privacy barriers that currently limit the free exchange of data that can improve the quality convenience and efficient delivery of care to accomplish this sharps has assembled an elite multidisciplinary team of healthcare and cyber security experts that is uniquely capable of carrying out an ambitious strategic program to bring security and privacy in health information technology to a new level of sophistication sharps will focus on three health information environments electronic health records health information exchange and telemedicine that are becoming increasingly popular in spite of security concerns with their use electronic health records although already prevalent in most u s hospitals are subject to risks that paper records are not such as the physical ease with which a thief can carry away thousands of patients records on a usb stick in his pocket further electronic records are vulnerable to internet based attacks if they are put online to increase accessibility health information exchange plays a crucial role whenever patients and their healthcare providers are not in the same place for example when a patient seeks emergency care while traveling far from home or a patient s primary care physician wishes to consult a specialist who is located at another institution in another state however such information exchange is greatly complicated by the fact that providers at different locations may be subject to different laws and institutional policies and may face different security threat levels furthermore multiple providers may be using different health information systems that are not compatible with each other finally telemedicine technologies that enable individuals to monitor and manage their health in settings outside hospitals is already being used to support a broad range of health and wellness goals such as chronic disease management and independent aging however security and privacy risks have been a major barrier to adoption networked sensing devices collect sensitive personal information from physiological data to information on patients activities and locations and networked implanted devices expose patients to new risks should adversaries find a way to control those devices bruce schneier noted author and chief security technology officer of bt praised the decision to establish the sharps program i believe in the sharps team their work will build technologies to make future health information systems more secure accurate and privacy preserving he stated john d halamka chief information officer of harvard medical school and beth israel deaconess medical center also expressed the view that the sharps project is addressing critical problems and has the expertise to make valuable contributions the advancement of security in healthcare information technology is an issue with far reaching implications warranting immediate attention he said we need

joined the coursera mooc platform the total number of participants in moocs through the university as a whole is nearly million courses through cs illinois account for of that number moocs enable participants to take courses anywhere they have access to a computer new recently announced specialization sequences added this spring will only help increase this presence developed at cs illinois as part of a partnership between coursera and the university of illinois two computer science specializations are now available one in data mining and one in cloud computing already the courses in these specializations have already acquired over learners the cloud computing specialization includes five courses in distributed systems cloud apps and networking the data mining specialization includes six courses in data mining text mining and data visualization both specializations require a capstone project which allows participants to demonstrate their new knowledge on a substantial project using realistic data indranil gupta there is hungry demand from companies for developers who understand how to use cloud computing systems how to build cloud computing systems and how to make these systems run efficiently said cs associate professor indranil gupta who is teaching the first course in the cloud computing specialization many people who already have some experience with computer systems want increase their knowledge base so that they can either apply for such jobs or write their own cloud computing services or systems students in gupta s cloud computing concepts course especially those who are full time employees in industry reported that they found the course to be intense but useful and rewarding in addition at least one startup that gupta knows of has most of its employees taking the course jiawei han one of the courses in the data mining specialization pattern discovery in data mining with cs professor jiawei han was listed as one of the top most anticipated moocs of as compiled by class central an aggregator of mooc course listings pattern discovery in data mining covers general concepts of data mining along with basic methodologies and applications students then move to an in depth look at pattern discovery a subfield in data mining more than learners registered for this course being created outside a classroom adds some challenges to course preparation materials have to be prepared meticulously to allow students with a wide range of backgrounds to understand the content teaching this course gives me many good lessons on how to prepare everything carefully and explain the concepts and methods down to the details said han it is a great experience and it will help my future teaching and research as well in the three years since joining coursera cs illinois has offered different courses and several have been offered multiple times the courses range in target audience from the general public such as a course on creating android apps to those for more specialized audiences such as a course on vlsi cad lawrence angrave the largest course from cs illinois was creative serious and playful science of android apps taught by cs lecturer lawrence angrave when first offered in that course had over enrolled which places it among the largest enrollment of any coursera course up to that time the broad reach moocs have helps illustrate the pervasive and global desire to learn for example the cloud computing concepts mooc with professor gupta has registered learners from different countries across the world the pattern discovery in data mining course with professor han had learners from countries while moocs offered through coursera can be taken free of charge there is a cost to receive a certificate for completing the signature tracks learners completing these tracks pay a fee of per course full certification for the specialization is also contingent on completing the capstone project other specialization partnerships between the university of illinois and coursera have been made with the college of business which also offers a pair of specializations collaborating with illinois college of media those

in distributed computing mon paypal youtube mosiac all three innovations were led by illinois computer science alumni and all three helped launch and shape the distributed computing revolution the latest incarnation of this revolution involves cloud computing massive datacenters and distributed data intensive computing which is poised to emerge as a multi billion dollar industry now illinois is expanding its toehold in distributed systems entrepreneurialism through a revamped graduate course offering in advanced distributed systems cs the course will focus the efforts of graduate students and advanced undergraduate students to create real world industry ready solutions to distributed systems challenges in the form of open source or licensable software the revamped course is made possible by a grant from the academy of entrepreneurial leadership at illinois given illinois history in leading distributed computing revolutions it seemed only natural to refocus the distributed systems course to be more entrepreneurial said computer science professor indranil gupta lead architect of the advanced distributed systems course illinois computer science professor indranil gupta firstly the atmosphere is highly conducive to entrepreneurial activity ranging from startups to nonprofit services in a wide variety of distributed systems both traditional as well as contemporary secondly students have always been at the source and fount of new ideas in distributed systems thirdly the success of our alumni is a testament that illinois is a unique source for such entrepreneurial activity traditional graduate level courses have a uniquely academic perspective students focus their studies on academic research papers and channel their contributions into publishing cutting edge research papers in journals or at conferences the cs distributed systems course by contrast will cover the field with both an academic and an industrial perspective covering papers not only from academia but also from industry s top researchers the nature of the student s projects which have so far been driven by the need to publish will add on a new layer students will now have the additional option to consider entrepreneurial motivations and value for their projects academic projects oriented towards cutting edge research will still form the core of the course projects youtube napster paypal no one s writing research about those kinds of systems but look at the impact that they have had remarked gupta it is my hope that with the cs course we will get some projects that will really have an impact on the industry and the course will will continue to have the kind of impact on academia that we have had in the past years of this course s offering we ve had tremendous success from this course since the projects from cs have resulted in papers in top journals and about papers in top conferences a majority of project papers make it into competitive conferences and or journals remarked gupta the open software releases from the course project are popular too a student released an open source tool that studied the characteristics of the pplive network that crawler tool and the data from this project have been downloaded by hundreds of researchers and by industry all over the world with little publicity or promotion the advanced distributed systems course is already one of the most popular graduate course offerings in computer science attracting a wide range of students in addition students in the course have access to use different cloud and distributed testbeds including the cloud computing testbed planetlab and emulab the diversity of interests and outlets in the course leaves gupta optimistic that some really interesting collaborations will result the university of illinois and the computer science department are uniquely positioned due to our history students infrastructures and course offerings to serve as a major catalyst for entrepreneurial activities in this new age of distributed systems said rob a rutenbar abel bliss professor of engineering and head of the computer science department this new course will help us better mentor and foster our student s entrepreneurial aspirations and enable illinois to have an even greater impact on the future of distributed systems the revised course will be offered for the first time in spring however the current spring offering of the course http www cs uiuc edu class sp cs has already begun to incorporate many elements of entrepreneurialism into it gupta and

jacobson by liz ahlberg u of i news bureau wed note the ncaa men s division i basketball tournament attracts millions of viewers each year many of whom like to play along at home or at the office by filling out tournament brackets the odds of filling out a perfect bracket are astronomical there are more possible brackets than stars in the galaxy so how can a march madness fan be confident in filling out if not a perfect bracket a pretty strong one cs professor sheldon h jacobson who has performed many data analytics studies on tournament bracketology talked about how seeds advance through the tournament with illinois news bureau physical sciences editor liz ahlberg sheldon h jacobson how can data analytics help with something as seemingly unpredictable as the march madness tournament how the seeds advance can be modeled using advanced analytical techniques we created two models that capture the seeds that consistently either win or lose in certain rounds the models allow checks and balances to assess whether a given bracket is reasonable or outrageously unusual it does not mean that any reasonable bracket will be a winning bracket but it does give you some sense of how much risk you are taking with a particular bracket that being said was a highly unusual year it was the fifth rarest final four seed combination over the past years in fact four of the last five tournaments have yielded relatively unusual final four seed combinations we may be due for more predictable years like a final four made up of seeds isn t it pretty safe to pick the no seeds to advance while everyone loves to focus on the no seeds our research suggests that the odds are high that two or three of the top seeds will not make the final four all our models indicate that there is a percent chance that only one or two of the no seeds will advance this far despite such odds no seeds do win the national championship more than any other seed no seeds are most vulnerable in the elite eight and national semifinals if they survive such games they are often quite successful in winning the national championship you created the bracketodds website to help people determine the statistical likeliness of their brackets based on your research how has your most recent work improved the site working with douglas m king a lecturer of industrial and enterprise systems engineering and arash khatibi a graduate student in that department we modeled combinations of seeds that advance through the tournament we introduced an earlier model for how seeds advance in the elite eight the national semifinals and the national finals and implemented it on the website back in the new models provide odds for these rounds as well as the sweet and the round of providing a more complete analysis of any given bracket the hardest rounds to predict are those early ones what does your research say about the first rounds and the sweet the round of is where the real upsets occur on average three teams seeded no or no will advanced from the round of each tournament among the teams seeded no or no picking one such team or two if you feel daring is always a good idea no teams are hard to predict they have been successful the past few years so we may be due for a dry period no teams have never won best to leave your bracket that way for the sweet make sure you include one team seeded no or worse this has occurred in more than percent of the past tournaments in fact in more than half the tournaments two such teams make this round among these seeds no and no have been most successful in fact the total number of teams seeded no and no that reached the sweet has been almost as much as the total number of teams seeded no no and no over the past tournaments so how can college basketball fans feel confident they have a pretty good bracket fill out your bracket backwards starting with the national champion then the national runner up then the final four and so forth mix a reasonable number of upsets into the rounds of and and the sweet sixteen our website provides some assistance with the odds in the elite eight and the final four if that all sounds like too much

primary links prospective students current students courses alumni research news department news e newsletter click magazine featured lectures videos corporate partners about us faculty positions staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news computer science points to holy grail of medical scheduling by doug peterson college of medicine thu most researchers develop collaborative projects with colleagues across the campus or across the hall but the collaboration between janet jokela md and sheldon jacobson phd is unique their collaboration was created across the kitchen table sheldon jacobson left and janet jokela jokela is the head of medicine in the university of illinois college of medicine at urbana and jacobson is a professor in the department of computer science but they also happen to be married they worked together to create a new computer program that solves one of the toughest scheduling problems in medicine in fact the marriage of their two minds stands as a fitting metaphor for the marriage of research efforts that is increasingly taking place between the colleges of medicine and engineering on the urbana campus when jokela became director of the university of illinois internal medicine residency program in she found herself grappling with the nightmare task that faces every residency director across the country each spring she had to balance a multitude of needs and requirements as she forged the annual schedule for medical residents working in two champaign urbana hospitals and the veteran s administration hospital in danville jacobson was astounded by the massive number of hours that jokela was putting in to develop this complex schedule so he proposed a solution i think this can be solved algorithmically he told her i believe we can build a model that would enable you to press a button and get your schedule automatically several years later they have succeeded jacobson and two students worked with jokela and others in the college of medicine to create a user friendly computer program that transforms a six week task into something that takes seconds their effort took top honors in the research poster competition for the association of program directors in internal medicine this april in nashville the new program reschedule med is in the initial testing stage the alpha stage when they work out the most glaring bugs the program has successfully produced schedules for the u of i residency program and they are aiming to do the beta testing in early other residency programs around the country are already lining up to participate resident can help drastically reduct the time needed to schedule residency rotations when jacobson first told jokela that he might be able to create a program to create schedules automatically she was skeptical it was difficult for me to envision how this could possibly be translated into a mathematical formula or algorithm what makes the task so difficult is that the schedules first must ensure that every one of the medical residents meets all of the educational requirements during four week rotation blocks at the hospitals for instance every resident must do at least one emergency medicine rotation before they graduate and they must do at least three intensive care unit rotations but no more than six on top of that the schedule must meet the many needs of the hospitals and a hospital s requirements differ for first second and third year residents making it even more complex are other requirements set by the national residency accreditation program for example residents cannot do two consecutive night shift rotations working p m to a m the complexity is daunting jokela said jacobson compared it to playing a high dimensional game of chess when you make a move in one dimension it affects every other dimension jokela said it takes roughly four to six weeks for several people to hammer out the initial draft of a residency schedule the old way by hand and then they start getting feedback from residents if a resident cannot do a rotation during a particular week that means tinkering with the schedule setting off a cascade of changes the schedule explodes in multiple dimensions jacobson said the new resident program has been designed to handle these changes with ease today jokela is head of the department of internal medicine and no longer has to set residency schedules but she continues to advise jacobson s team as they refine the computer program she also raises awareness of the new tool when she told tom cooney md the governor of the oregon chapter of the american college of physicians about the computer program his eyes got very big he told me do you realize that this is the holy grail of internal medicine residency directors if you could solve this problem that would be huge cooney who is also the former long time director of the internal medicine residency program at oregon told her that a number of years ago a private company poured millions of dollars into a similar effort to solve the scheduling dilemma but they never succeeded to create the new program jacobson worked with david morrison a phd student in computer science and two computer science undergraduates jiayi guo and j taylor fairbank the illinois team used integer programming a modeling technique in the field of operations research jacobson s area of expertise you define a set of variables that have integer values he said every single resident has a large number of variables which are like

this year so did sheldon h jacobson a professor of computer science and director of the simulation optimization lab to answer the big question jacobson along with a group of computer science and industrial engineering students created a sophisticated computer model that takes an advanced computing approach to predict the outcome their results are presented online at electionanalytics cs illinois edu illinois computer science professor sheldon jacobson while most opinion polls touted in the national news media only provide estimates of the nationwide popular vote jacobson s mathematical model uses state polling data running the results through a dynamic programming algorithm before making a prediction the results from the and presidential elections suggest that it can be difficult to predict the winner of the presidential election based on popular vote says jacobson in fact it is possible that the popular vote and the electoral college vote can lead to significantly different results working with st louis university s steven rigdon jacobson s model employs bayesian estimators using the available state poll results to determine the probability that each candidate will win each of the states presently he s using state polling data available from realclearpolitics com including polls from rasmussen quinnipiac gallup and survey usa among others these state by state probabilities are then used in a dynamic programming algorithm developed with edward c sewell southern illinois university edwardsville to determine a probability distribution for the number of electoral college votes that each candidate will win in the presidential election he has reason to believe that his model provides a more realistic method of predicting the results in when most other polls showed senator kerry with a clear edge his model consistently showed a bush victory in he was able to forecast all but one state correctly indiana was the lone outlier by a very small margin one reason for the accuracy could be jacobson s method of assigning safe states we take into account safe states the states that each candidate is certain to win says jacobson in once you took into account bush s safe states he had a much narrower gap to close to get to electoral votes than kerry in obama s safe states guaranteed his victory in jacobson s model a safe state is one in which the candidate is computed to have an chance or greater of winning the state another interesting feature of jacobson s model is its treatment of undecided voters undecided voters can have a significant role on the outcome of the election in fact they are likely to be the ultimate deciders of who will win this election says jacobson the model accounts for five different voting scenarios involving undecided voters each considered individually a neutral scenario provides an unbiased handling of undecided voters strong republican and strong democratic scenarios provide two extreme envelopes around which results can be judged and evaluated while mild republican and mild democratic provide more realistic possibilities if late breaking information surfaces that shift or sway voter

has changed in large and sometimes unpopular ways in an interview with news bureau physical sciences editor liz ahlberg computer science professor and aviation security expert sheldon h jacobson discusses the impact of these changes and considerations for the future of air travel safety with the passing of the th anniversary of sept how has airport security changed in no other facet of society have the events of that day had a more enduring effect than on aviation security operations there have been tremendous changes in how we execute and operate the aviation security system at the commercial airports around the united states with the creation of the transportation security administration came technologies such as explosive detection systems trace devices puffers and advanced imaging technologies full body scanners along with policies requiring passengers to remove their shoes and carry liquids and gels in bags all designed to secure the air system illinois computer science professor sheldon jacobson with all these changes and the resources invested is the air system safer today than it was on september in absolute terms the answer is yes we are safer from all the threats we know about however if we look at the trajectory of where aviation security is heading and the potential threats that could come onto the horizon in many ways aviation security is at its riskiest and weakest point ever every action and every layer of aviation security that has been added to the system has been based on a reaction to a previous threat the shoe bomber incident led to the shoe screening policy while the bag policy was instituted after the plot to blow up planes bound for the united states with liquid explosives more recently the christmas day bomber incident led to the deployment of advanced imaging technologies and pat downs for all passengers in all these cases the policy changes followed the terrorist incident this raises the question are there other threats lurking on the horizon that the aviation security system is ill prepared to defend against it is important that we protect ourselves from what we know but the difficulty is and the challenge is being able to protect ourselves against what we do not know as long as we continue to focus our attention on screening for threat objects or items and not really focus on the real threat which are the people who want to cause danger and problems with the system then in fact we are very vulnerable what should passengers be concerned about passengers should not be concerned with the security breaches or the kinds of screens they are being subjected to but be much more concerned with what i call the security holes places in the system where the layers do not cover people who are intent on causing harm to the air system are constantly testing the system and with enough trial they will find these holes the events of sept were not a breach in aviation security they were based on the security policies in place at that time and the problems with them if we perpetuate that kind of activity and thinking then we will continue to have problems the focus has to be much more on allocating and using our scarce security resources in the optimal way so that travelers when they get on an airplane are going to feel more secure and more comfortable and know that their interests are being protected what about advanced imaging technologies or full body scanners as they are known is such invasive screening necessary advanced imaging technologies provide their own unique set of challenges given how they are being used they do have a certain role because they are able to detect items that metal detectors cannot the most significant value that they provide is their deterrence effect however current throughput rates for such devices are inadequate to handle all passengers particularly at high volume airports during peak travel times this means that not all passengers can be screened using such technologies as a result the decision to screen someone or not is tantamount to flipping a coin based on whether the advanced imaging technology device is available when a passenger reaches the checkpoint screening location if we re going to use full body scanners we have to use them intelligently and using them for primary screening and attempting to screen everybody as much as the volume will allow has actually made the system less secure but don t all passengers present some level of risk to the air systems and require comparable levels of screening no we can actually look at research and discern the fact that a certain percentage of travelers and passengers just do not pose any threat to the system we have spent billions of dollars since with a significant portion of that being spent to screen frequent business travelers grandmothers and other passengers who pose no threat to the system and if we use security resources on them we re basically diverting away from the people who really require greater the way our research looks at it is that we want to right size security we don t want to under screen people we don t want to over screen people right now we re over screening a tremendous number of people and we re under screening a small number of people if we right size screen we can actually end up with a more secure system how can we

bureau thu think picking all the top seeded teams as the final four in your march madness bracket is your best bet for winning the office pool think again according to an operations research analysis model developed by sheldon h jacobson a professor of computer science and the director of the simulation and optimization laboratory at the university of illinois you re better off picking a combination of two top seeded teams a no seed and a no seed sheldon h jacobson a professor of computer science says his operations research analysis model shows picking a combination of top seeded teams will give you the best odds of winning the final four office pool photo by l brian stauffer there are patterns that exist in the seeds jacobson says as much as we like to believe otherwise the fact of the matter is that we ve uncovered a model that captures this pattern as a result of that in spite of what we emotionally feel about teams or who s going to win the reality is that the numbers trump all of these things jacobson said it s more likely to be in the final four than four no s jacobson s model is unique in that it prognosticates not based on who the teams are but on the seeds they hold he describes his model in a forthcoming paper in the journal omega with co authors alex nikolaev of the university of buffalo adrian lee of citeri central illinois technology and education research institute and douglas king a graduate student at illinois jacobson has also integrated the model into a user friendly website to help march madness fans determine the relative probability of their chosen team combinations appearing in the final rounds of the ncaa men s basketball tournament a number of websites offer assistance to budding bracketologists such as game by game probabilities of certain match ups or determining the spread on a given team reaching a particular point in the tournament jacobson s website is the only one to look at collective groups of seeds within the brackets what we do is use the power of analytics to uncover trends in bracketology it really is a mathematical science he said what our model enables us to do is look at the likelihood or probability that a certain set of seed combinations will occur as we advance deeper into the tournament jacobson s team applied a statistical method called goodness of fit testing to ncaa tournament data from to identifying patterns in seed distribution in the elite eight final four and national championship rounds they found that the seeds themselves exhibit certain statistical patterns independent of the team they then fit the pattern to a stochastic model they can use to assess probabilities and odds two computer science undergraduates ammar rizwan and emon dai built the website bracketodds cs illinois edu based on jacobson s model the publicly accessible website will be up through the entire tournament users can evaluate their brackets and also can compare relative likelihood of two sets of seed combinations undergraduates ammar rizwan left and emon dai both in computer science built the website bracketodds cs illinois edu based on sheldon jacobson s model photo by l brian stauffer for each of the rounds that we have available you could put in what you have so far and even compare it to other possible sets rizwan said for example the probability of the final four comprising the four top seeded teams is or once every years meanwhile the probability of a final four of all no seeds the lowest seeded teams in the tournament is so small that it has a frequency of happening once every eight hundred trillion years the milky way contains about an estimated one hundred billion stars basically if every star was given a year the years it would take for this to occur is times all the stars in the galaxy jacobson said it gives you perspective however sets with long odds do happen the most unlikely combination in the years studied occurred in with a final four seed combination of and but such a bracket is only predicted to happen once every years so those filling out brackets at home shouldn t hope for a repeat what amateur bracketologists can be confident of is upsets for even the most probable final four combination of to occur two top seeded schools have to lose in fact upsets occur with great frequency and great predictability if you look statistically there s a certain number of upsets that occur in each round we just don t know which team they re going to be or when they re going to occur jacobson said after the tournament and in years to come jacobson will integrate the new data into the model to continually refine its prediction power for jacobson rizwan and dai hope to integrate a comparative probability feature into the website to allow users to calculate for example the probability of a particular set of final four seeds if the elite eight seeds are given until then users can find out how likely their picks really are and compare them against friends picks or even sports commentators we re not here specifically to say syracuse is going to beat kentucky in the elite eight what we re saying is that the seed numbers have patterns

areas phil ciciora university of illinois news bureau thu a new study analyzing the impact of hand held cell phone legislation on driving safety concludes that usage ban laws had more of an impact in densely populated urban areas with a higher number of licensed drivers than in rural areas where there are fewer licensed drivers according to a university of illinois researcher illinois computer science professor sheldon jacobson the study conducted by sheldon h jacobson a professor of computer science and the director of the simulation and optimization laboratory at illinois analyzed the relationship between pre and post law automobile accident rates using public data from counties in new york jacobson and co researchers alexander g nikolaev and matthew j robbins published their results in an article titled evaluating the impact of legislation prohibiting hand held cell phone use while driving which will appear in a forthcoming issue of the journal transportation research part a policy and practice the team found that after banning hand held cell phone use while driving counties in new york experienced lower fatal accident rates of which did so at a statistically significant level while all counties experienced lower personal injury accident rates they also discovered that the personal injury accident rate decrease was more substantive in counties such as bronx new york and queens where there was a high density of licensed drivers rather than in sparsely populated areas of upstate new york what that suggests is if you have a congestion of cars and you re distracted you re more likely to hit someone jacobson said if you have a lower congestion of cars you re still distracted but you re less likely to hit anyone because there are less people to hit it s simple probability driver distraction is thought to be the cause of nearly percent of automobile accidents in the u s resulting in about deaths injuries and million instances of property damage annually although a ban on hand held cell phone use while driving in rural areas has less of an impact on driver safety jacobson says that doesn t necessarily mean the ban itself is worthless hand held cell phone bans are very valuable in high density urban areas but less so in lower density rural areas jacobson said but that doesn t mean they have no impact in rural areas it just means that such legislation is less likely to have an impact on driver accident rates jacobson s study differs from other studies in that rather than focusing on reaction times of simulated drivers in lab setting it analyzed publicly available data of accident rates published by the new york state department of motor vehicles to allow for a proper comparison between time periods the years to were treated as the pre law time period and the years to were considered as the post law time period nobody s done a study like this before he said everything prior to this is a micro analysis of reaction time in laboratories by researchers the challenge jacobson said was getting the right data to analyze the best state that had the data to analyze was new york he said they ve had the hand held cell phone ban in place since so we had a lot of data relatively speaking in that we had a before and after snapshot of accident rates jacobson said one of the limitations of the study is extrapolating the data from new york state and projecting it onto the nation at large that s fraught with problems but these are limitations we acknowledge he said every state is unique but the overall conclusions still stand to reason jacobson who also holds appointments as a professor of industrial and enterprise systems engineering of civil and environmental engineering and of pediatrics at illinois says the holy grail of data sets to analyze would be the property damage data collected by insurance companies jacobson says the difference between his study and one recently published by the highway loss data institute an affiliate of the insurance institute for highway safety is that he used publicly available data and the number of licensed drivers as a proxy for accident prediction the insurance industry backed report studied pre and post ban insurance claims from accidents in california connecticut new york and washington d c it contends that state laws banning the use of cell phones while driving didn t reduce the number of vehicle crashes if the property damage data were available to jacobson and his co researchers we could come up with a more definitive statement he said but even with this we still saw some very compelling trends that would support the legislative push at the state and federal level for distracted driver legislation it s certainly a topical problem another challenge for jacobson and his team was how to standardize accident data across the counties their solution was to use the number of licensed drivers and compare the statistical inferences to licensed driver density measuring the throughput of cars is very difficult jacobson said as a result using the number of licensed drivers is a reasonable way to standardize and licensed driver density provided an interesting measure to compare the counties measuring the throughput of cars is very difficult jacobson said as a result using the number of licensed drivers is a reasonable way to standardize and licensed driver density provided an interesting measure to compare the counties

their annual march madness office pool a university of illinois professor has some advice on how to pick winners in the later rounds of the tournament ignore a team s seeding which is a statistically insignificant predictor of a team s chances of winning according to sheldon h jacobson a professor of computer science and the director of the simulation and optimization laboratory at illinois for the top three seeds in the four regional brackets the road to the final four of the ncaa men s division i basketball championship will most likely play out according to their initial seeding in the first three rounds of the tournament that is the higher seeded teams will most likely beat their lower seeded opponents but once the field has been winnowed to the so called elite eight teams jacobson says each team s odds of winning are statistically no different than a coin flip no matter how high or low the teams were initially ranked at the start of the tournament the deeper you get into the tournament jacobson said the less effective seeding is in predicting winners jacobson said that for the teams that comprise the top three seeds in each of the four regional brackets seeding is an excellent predictor of the outcomes of the first three rounds of games with those teams in the first round the no seed has beaten the no seed percent of the time jacobson said but after the sweet sixteen it is a statistical toss up as to who wins the remaining games a team s seeding can be thrown out the window they really do not give you a good indication of who is going to win the games jacobson who along with graduate student douglas m king wrote an article titled seeding in the ncaa men s basketball tournament when is a higher seed better that will be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal of gambling business and economics said the impetus of the study was not to predict brackets or winners in advance of the tournament but to see if the top three teams seeding in each bracket is a good predictor of how far they will go in the big dance i have always been surprised that the first seeds seem to do better than the second seeds who seem to do better than the third seeds jacobson said because you would think that there is not really a big difference between the top three seeds from each of the four regions so is there a statistically significant difference between what are ostensibly the top teams in the country the answer is both yes and no jacobson said there are differences but it is not a question as to whether they are different it is a question as to when they are different based on the rounds of the tournament seeds are important but they start to lose their strength beginning in the sweet sixteen round by the time they reach the elite eight those teams were not statistically different than anyone else in the field jacobson said that tournament seedings which are determined by a member committee of ncaa basketball athletic directors and conference commissioners from across the country are an easy convenient predictor for people with little knowledge of the current college basketball scene but are ultimately useless in predicting the final three rounds of the six round tournament seasoned tournament watchers jacobson said may have seized upon this prediction strategy years ago but he s definitively proven it through statistical analysis of data from the modern era of the tournament beginning in when the field expanded to teams in the tournament expanded to include a th team in an opening round game what we are revealing statistically is something that college basketball fans probably already knew in their gut that a team s seeding provides some indication as to how well it is going to do but it does not necessarily give you the definitive predictor jacobson said there are always upsets there are always cinderellas who make the sweet sixteen the elite eight and even the final four like george mason did a few years ago for the average college basketball fan looking for an edge in their bracket predictions jacobson advises picking the higher seeds to beat their lower seeded opponents in the first two rounds but warned that the seed rankings begin to fall apart soon thereafter in the sweet sixteen round the rankings still hold but just barely he said from the elite eight round and onward you might as well pick names out of a hat jacobson said that other intangible factors besides a team s initial seeding such as player match ups a team s style of play and its relative hotness or coldness prior to the game has a greater effect on the outcome of contests in the later rounds of the tournament especially when you get into the elite eight jacobson said that is when you are going to see teams you do not expect to win ending up winning games at a higher statistical rate than would be expected despite its weakness as a predictive model jacobson doesn t believe the seed based ranking system used by the ncaa needs to be replaced wholesale the committee has a very challenging job seeding the teams and the tournament format by design is exciting he said we are talking about

school dropout to graduation by mike koon college of engineering thu marrissa hellesen is just a few weeks away from completing her bachelor of science degree requirements from one of the most prestigious computer science programs in the world earlier this spring the year old was honored as one of knights of st patrick a distinction given to a select group of top students in the college of engineering to say her journey to graduation day has been filled with challenges would be an understatement marrissa hellesen s many accomplishments include being named a knight of st patrick and receiving the h l wakeland undergraduate leadership award hellesen just the second member of her family to go to college is a testament not only of belief and determination but also of how important it is for others to walk alongside providing support and confidence her story has included a lot of tears some of disappointment but many of joy hellesen s journey began years ago when at the age of the rockford native decided to drop out of school disillusioned by going to class she got her ged and entered the work force a year later with minimal sleep she worked two jobs both in rockford and for a few months in dallas for the next two years one of those jobs was at a tech support call center for t mobile which provided that aha moment for hellesen there were people on my team in their s she said i really saw what my life would be if i continued on that trajectory and realized i didn t want to do this forever when i took the ged i was saying i just didn t want to deal with this anymore i thought if i had my ged people would leave me alone i never saw myself as someone who was going to do something awesome i was just there and i felt that was how people saw me hellesen decided to take classes at rock valley college and stumbled upon the first of many challenges she would face her placement tests put her at elementary algebra four courses below college level that meant she would have to take two years of courses before she would even be able to take a college level math course i was devastated she said i cried about it for a long time and then i just did it turning the corner the decision to go back to school sparked a series of events that brought special people into hellesen s life and instilled confidence in a heart that was struggling to find hope she was introduced to the man who would eventually become her husband jeff a political science student at northern illinois university as their love grew they would ironically spend much of the next few years living apart hellesen moved in with her now boyfriend s parents in palatine helping take care of his mom who was struggling with health issues while jeff spent a year studying in china after jeff returned hellesen transferred to kishwaukee community college to be closer to him that led her to meet another important person in helping to shape her life steve dunn hellesen took the math placement test again but was still placed in geometry devastated once more she called jeff and told him she didn t think she could do it but he continued to encourage her then dunn who taught all the engineering courses at the community college came to her geometry class to recruit students into the program his encouragement helped change hellesen s career path steve was the coolest dude ever hellesen recalled he came into our class turned the desk around sat backwards and proceeded to tell us how we could take physics and be in engineering no one thought i could be an engineer but he thought i could i knew i enjoyed technical challenges and playing with the computer but i never thought that was an option for me dunn thought enough of hellesen that he let her into the program early one math class short of the prerequisite when joe waranyuwat the coordinator of transfer programs for the university of illinois college of engineering came to campus he invited hellesen to the presentation i thought to myself that is really cool maybe i ll go to the u of i she said not even realizing the reputation of the college her confidence starting to grow hellesen jumped into student life helping start the lgbtq allies group on campus tutoring in math courses the semester after she took them and eventually being elected student government president when waranyuwat came back the following year hellesen learned about the transfer agreement the college had with kishwaukee got a list of the requirements and was even more determined to earn a spot at illinois i had the piece of paper and for two years i was checking things off hellesen said i was advocating for students while still able to maintain my sanity and do really well in the courses i was in the perfect environment to make it happen under dunn s guidance hellesen completed the requirements and enrolled at illinois in the fall of a rude awakening i didn t really know about illinois reputation but jeff did she

to this point has been an intense experience for the university of illinois students alejandro gomez danylo hirnyj ehsan keramat linas sulas sam liu and sunny gautam each year nasa receives over proposals for the reduced gravity program and invites around of the best proposals to houston s johnson space center and to fly at ellington field in the previous year the moon goons team did not make the shortlist but with perseverance they rewrote the proposal strengthened their school outreach plans and created a winning entry their hard work also brought them a prize one of the winners of best undergraduate research at illinois s engineering open house and a week at nasa s base at houston to learn about space safe g flying and to prepare and then fly their quadrocopter experiment the first of two g flight day thursday includes team members dan alejandro sunny and myself lawrence angrave the photo journalist for the team the team is nervous and excited it s the maiden g voyage of the quadrocopter or drone experiment and we re not sure how it will perform but we re in great hands nasa has been very careful to ensure our safety g flight requires all tools bolts and loose items be accounted for and the experiment be strongly secured before the flight we ve also taken anti motion sickness medication and are reminded that avoiding neck movements and staying still during the g pull up phases will help avoid motion sickness feet down warns the nasa flyer before alejandro even makes it to the laptop to start the experiment the plane pulls out of its dive and we drop hard on the floor for the second parabola out of sunny and dan are in position but alejandro has a surprise waiting for him his long dreadlocks have caught on some velcro on standard earth gravity g he would simply stand and pull his hair lose but in g his body floats up and the slight tug on his hair has now rotated him upside down fortunately he is rescued by a nearby nasa engineer who quickly grabs and rotates alejandro before the g pull up preparing for takeoff and the experiment at the laptop by the third parabola alejandro has found the foot straps and is at the laptop ready to tell the quadrocopter to fly to the dock the laptop provides the computational power it s the brains behind the quadrocopter translating the real time camera images transmitted from the quadrocopter into power changes of each of the four motors thanks to electrical engineering major sunny gautum it s reliably receiving a wireless video stream of pictures per second from a camera mounted on the side of the quadrocopter sunny developed the communication system and also discovered how to work around the drone s inbuilt software that assumed it was operating in earth s gravity the laptop is running a vision algorithm that searches for the red cloth background and quickly makes power adjustments to the four propellers to turn the drone towards the red cloth analyzing images is an active area of computer science research explains computer science major sam liu responsible for the quadrocopter s vision system early on in the design i used a sliding window detection algorithm but in testing found its performance was too slow to control the quadrocopter so we simplified the processing required by using a large red cloth and a faster color moment algorithm it s fast and sufficient to tell us when the craft has rotated away from the desired docking angle so we can add extra thrust to some of the fans the drone inside its cage with the illinois logo shown the moon goon s experiment is inspired by the original lunar landing module but today they are testing two new docking systems first using a vision system to control the quadrocopter and second using lorentz force magnetic braking to slow the machine as it nears the target due to the second duration of each g parabola the drone s movements were purposely constrained to one linear and one rotational degree of freedom these constraints are now the cause of the moon goon s very own problem at houston the fans whirr and pulse but are ineffective against the friction the drone refuses to fly dan and sunny open up the safety cage designed by linas and attempt to free the quadrocopter while alejandro debugs and recompiles the code his long dreadlocks unshackled from gravity s tug explore and waft gently in every possible direction this is first time i ve seen illinois students debug code at ft

evolution mon cs and bioengineering professor tandy warnow was one of several scientists from north america europe and china who have published a paper in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that reveals important details about key transitions in the evolution of plant life on our planet tandy warnow from strange and exotic algae mosses ferns trees and flowers growing deep in steamy rainforests to the grains and vegetables we eat and the ornamental plants adorning our homes all plant life on earth shares over a billion years of history our study generated dna sequences from a vast number of distantly related plants and we developed new analysis tools to understand their relationships and the timing of key innovations in plant evolution said jim leebens mack associate professor of plant biology at the university of georgia and coordinating author of the paper as part of the one thousand plants kp initiative the research team is generating millions of gene sequences from plant species sampled from across the green tree of life by resolving these relationships the international research team is illuminating the complex processes that allowed ancient water faring algae to evolve into land plants with adaptations to competition for light water and soil nutrients lead author norm wickett of the chicago botanic garden described the study as like taking a time machine back to get a glimpse of how ancient algae transitioned into the diverse array of plants we depend on for our food building materials and critical ecological services when plants colonized the land million years ago it changed the world forever said simon malcomber program director in the national science foundation s division of environmental biology which funded the research the results of this study offer new insights into the relationships among living plants as plants grew and thrived across the plains valleys and mountains of earth s landscape rapid changes in their structures gave rise to a myriad of new species and the group s data also helps scientists better understand the ancestry of the most common plant linages including flowering plants and non flowering cone bearing plants such pine trees the investigation has also revealed a number of previously unknown molecular characteristics of some plant species that may have applications in medicine and industry we are using this diverse set of sequences to make many exciting discoveries with implications across the life sciences said gane ka shu wong principal investigator for kp professor at the university of alberta and associate director of bgi shenzhen for example new algal proteins identified in our sequence data are being used to investigate how the mammalian brain works seeing the impact that kp has had inspired us to launch a series of species projects for organisms like insects birds and fish said yong zhang director of the china national genebank cngb taming big data the project required an extraordinary level of computing power to store and analyze the massive libraries of genetic data which was provided by the iplant collaborative at the university of arizona the texas advanced computing center tacc compute calcul canada and cngb this study demonstrates how life scientists are using high performance computing resources to analyze astronomically large datasets to answer fundamental questions that were previously thought to be intractable said iplant s naim matasci cs illinois professor tandy warnow and her student siavash mirarab developed new methods for analyzing the massive datasets used in the project the datasets we were analyzing in this study were too big and too challenging for existing statistical methods to handle so we developed approaches with better accuracy warnow said many organizations including iplant cngb and the computational analysis of novel drug opportunities cando group at suny buffalo have joined forces to provide web based open access to these results the resources and sequence repositories are described in a companion paper published in gigascience ultimately the researchers hope that their project will not only help us understand the origins and development of plant life but also provide researchers with a new framework for the study of evolution we hope that this study will help settle some longstanding scientific debates concerning plant relationships and others will use our data to further elucidate the molecular evolution of plant genes and genomes leebens mack said the paper is available on the

the number of cyber crimes has steadily risen over the years the number of cyber security experts needed to stop them has not kept pace roy campbell left and other icssp faculty and students gather during the hacking workshop put on by the students on december the university of illinois at urbana champaign has received a four year million grant from the national science foundation to renew a program that trains students in cyber security a field that is projected to experience an annual shortage of to skilled workers for the foreseeable future according to a reuters report the illinois cyber security scholars program icssp teaches students how to protect the nation s cyber infrastructure by designing more secure systems and methodologies as well as better cyber policy from cell phones to online banking our daily functions are extremely digitized which means they are also vulnerable to attacks said roy campbell the lead researcher for the icssp initiative and the sohaib and sara abbasi professor of computer science our goal with icssp is to train students to have an immediate impact in the field especially at government agencies and laboratories cyber security education has become a national imperative the white house recently called for a national strategy similar to the effort to upgrade science and mathematics education in the s to meet the growing demand for skilled professionals illinois has a strong tradition in security graduating about students each year with expertise in the area when the icssp program was added in it gave computer science undergraduates the opportunity to enhance their cyber security skills however the new icssp will offer a multidisciplinary approach to cyber security bringing together computer science and engineering undergraduate and graduate students and law students who are needed to write policies that better protect the technology systems of the st century law students and computer science students will take courses in the other discipline to enhance their knowledge of both fields graduates of the program will receive a certificate in cyber security participating students will take cyber security courses as part of their regular degree program dedicating the elective courses built into both the engineering and law programs to cyber security training icssp which takes two to three years to complete and will train students in the cohort provides scholarships that cover tuition professional development and travel and also offers a stipend to participants in return students are required to intern with a government agency or laboratory and upon graduation work for the government for as many years as they spent in the scholarship program icssp students and faculty members gather during the hacking

they will do everything from the front end analysis of cyber threats to developing robust and state of the art tools programs and systems for the cyber world law students will train for careers in the government private companies and law firms dealing with how our civil and criminal legal systems can advance protection for our cyber infrastructure and deter cyber attacks while operating within current and future legal constraints and maintaining important privacy protections we all know that this is a new frontier in national security said professor of law jay kesan an iti researcher and co pi on the icssp grant you really want lawyers to understand both the technical side of information systems as well as the legal and policy issues so that we can have the kind of regulatory regimes and policy discussions that move this field forward icssp has enjoyed a percent placement rate of its graduates since its inception placement with agencies isn t guaranteed and graduates who are not chosen must pay back the scholarship money demonstrating the strength of illinois expertise in the area bashir said many graduates are now working at high level research labs such as sandia national laboratories and los alamos national lab along with numerous government agencies such as the department of homeland security and the cia the professors hope that if students are introduced to cyber security early in their educational careers they will become excited about working in this important field of study i once had a student tell me i see this as a way to defend my country without

positions staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news campbell to help develop ambitious new digital forensics curriculum jenny applequist tue computer science professor roy h campbell and collegues in the information trust institute iti have received a grant from the national science foundation that will support development of a new undergraduate educational curriculum in digital forensics addressing a national shortage of trained cyber security professionals forensics is the use of scientific methods to obtain information with legal significance and digital forensics is a type of forensics that deals with recovery and investigation of data in digital devices digital crime and the need to use digital evidence in investigations are both growing dramatically in today s technology dependent world consequently digital forensics is now a major part of many criminal investigations and its tools are frequently and increasingly being used by law enforcement agencies according to one estimate the number of jobs related to digital forensics will increase by over from to unfortunately the skilled workers needed for those jobs don t exist the strongly multidisciplinary nature of digital forensics has been a significant barrier to entry into the field expertise in computer science is not enough forensics practitioners must also have a solid understanding of legal procedures laws of evidence and investigative techniques most computer scientists don t have enough legal understanding even to present facts appropriately in court and many don t realize how easily they might commit crimes themselves while taking action to address possible malicious activity prof roy h campbell you want to have a chain of legal custody associated with digital information and that requires you to treat the gathering of information in a manner that s not typical of the way computer scientists deal with it explains campbell the leader of the new iti effort you really have to consider are you tampering with the evidence in some way are you destroying its content are you invalidating the logical chain of evidence by doing something to the computer it s also bringing in the notion of weighing of evidence what is likely to have occurred what is not likely to have occurred nowadays that can be quite interesting and difficult technically dr masooda bashir who is the managing director and a co principal investigator of the new program explains the need for a new curriculum while several academic programs on digital forensics have already been developed the field and its curriculum standards are still evolving therefore without a standard curriculum there may be great inconsistency among the university programs being offered the aim of our project is to develop and implement a model curriculum in digital forensics that balances the various necessary multidisciplinary components and to work for acceptance of that model as a standard for education in digital forensics to address the challenge of teaching such a complex topic the iti development team includes not just faculty in computer science and computer engineering but also experts in criminal justice law sociology and educational assessment one of the things we re guilty of in computer science and computer engineering is being very focused very siloed campbell observes the problem is that computer science is stretched out now into social networking into business and accounting into relationships between people and there are all sorts of aspects of human behavior interacting with computers that are not addressed in a computer science program not addressed in a sociology program and so on for data forensics you really want to have a body of professionals that understand all the needs the curriculum resources to be created will be usable as the basis for future academic programs distance learning and multidisciplinary multi institutional programs that meet evolving standards specialized curricula will be developed to meet the needs of both universities and two year colleges and a k outreach program will translate the educational materials and program to levels suitable for a wider audience much of the material including a virtual laboratory and class notes will be provided on line and shared with other institutions campbell reflects that the new digital forensics effort may broaden iti s perspective on trust we have established the information trust institute as one of the premier research institutes in computer security power grid security infrastructure security and so on but we what we need to do very much is think about the interaction of computers with society and with policymaking and i think that the forensics project will push us in the direction of considering trust in a broader sense computer forensics can be applied to all the things iti does it s another step in the way iti is maturing iti not only has great depth in particular areas but is now extending its knowledge into the relationships of technology society and the legal system campbell is the sohaib

interesting computing challenges of today jing gao as the saying goes two heads are better than one this axiomatic principle forms the guideline and central theme for jing gao s research in knowledge integration her work draws from data mining and machine learning to create knowledge integration among multiple information sources her work combines multiple base models known as ensembles for better predictions while there is an abundance of data sources available to users today there is lots of risk in relying on any single model for decision making in terms of making the best choice to maximize your benefits to reduce this risk and make accurate learning predictions combining sources offers an attractive method but the data is so huge that you can t really combine it at the data level cautions jing it s only feasible to do at the model level one of the key trends in information technology is for increasingly large and disparate sources of data and that s why it s so important that we get this knowledge integration right knowledge integration holds the key for intelligent decision making in many emerging applications and has already shown its power in multiple disciplines including recommendation systems like the netflix prize anomaly detection stream mining and web applications jing plans to extend the scope of her ensemble methods to several other data mining functions including ranking anomaly detection and veracity analysis she also plans to investigate knowledge synthesizing over multiple heterogeneous information networks as the impact of web technologies continues to expand the amount and type of information available jing works with prof jiawei han in the database and information systems laboratory she received her b e and m e in computer science from the harbin institute of technology in harbin china in jing did an internship with ibm t j watson research center where she designed a supervised discriminative pattern mining algorithm in conjunction with the ibm infosphere warehouse intelligent miner eric rozier eric w d rozier who conducts his research as part of the information trust institute at illinois is pursuing research on simulation of rare events in large scale systems such simulation addresses systems in which important events occur at a variety of vastly different rates such that the fastest and slowest rates in the system may differ by orders of magnitude those systems are challenging to simulate because in order to model system behavior over a span of time long enough to include an adequate number of rare event occurrences it may be necessary to model an immense number of frequently occurring events since the computation time involved in solving a system model is generally determined by the number of events fired systems with rare events typically result in stiff models that are too large and complex to solve the research challenge is to find a way to make solution of such systems mathematically tractable storage systems an application area in which rozier has been collaborating with ibm researchers are a notable real world example of systems with rare events in addition to their normal faults such as hard disk failures storage systems are affected by potentially devastating but exceedingly rare events called undetected disk errors in those errors the disk writes to the wrong sector or says it s written to the right sector when it actually wrote nothing these are very hard to catch says rozier and they can cause massive problems and they become more relevant with systems like blue waters because in large petascale systems these rare events that before you might not expect to see for maybe years of runtime now will occur roughly every days rozier earned a bachelor s degree in computer science from the college of william and mary in and since has been a graduate student in the research group of prof william h sanders at illinois in and he did two

the systems on nanoscale information fabrics sonic center the center part of a new million initiative called the semiconductor technology advanced research network starnet will focus on substantially enhancing the information processing power and storage capacity of integrated circuits ics and related systems which is critical in maintaining reliability as devices continue to shrink and improve in energy efficiency society is increasingly dependent on electronic information and has come to expect electronic devices cell phones tablets laptops cameras and others to decrease in cost offer more features and provide longer lasting battery power in the past such advances have been made possible by the frequent reduction in size of a basic building block the transistor switch sonic director naresh shanbhag today these switches are so small that their behavior is fraught with uncertainty due to quantum effects the challenge is to design reliable and energy efficient computing systems using the unreliable switches that arise as researchers seek to make devices even smaller and more energy efficient sonic s innovative research agenda seeks to address this issue by treating the problem of computing using unreliable devices and circuits as one of communicating information over unreliable channels essentially we re not going to try to build a reliable switch but instead discover methods to build reliable systems said sonic director naresh shanbhag the jack s kilby professor of electrical and computer engineering it turns out that while information resides at the highest level and nanoscale components at the lowest level they can both be mathematically described with the same statistical framework no one has successfully captured this similarity between them before rob a rutenbar computer science department head and abel bliss professor as moore s law nears it inevitable end it s essential to figure out how we can make reliable computations work on the statistically messy nanoscale circuit fabrics that will come next says rob a rutenbar head of the department of computer science the sonic team is perfectly poised to solve these tough problems rutenbar a member of the sonic executive committee was previously the founding director of one of the predecessor src darpa centers in this area the million c s center which focused on design issues at the end of conventional circuit scaling the center seeks to create a new computing paradigm using information processing instead of data processing to extend scaling of nanoscale devices beyond what is feasible today computing devices today are primarily data pipes and data crunchers by borrowing probabilistic techniques from the field of communications sonic researchers plan to transform these systems into statistical information processors that are able to infer intent and handle uncertainty while consuming much less energy than traditional computers sonic is supported by starnet which will provide funding over the next five years to six centers at universities funded by the department of defense and u s semiconductor and supplier companies as a public private partnership

positions staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news illinois developed data creation tool a boon for genetic biologists liz ahlberg illinois news bureau tue with the beespace navigator university of illinois researchers have created both a curation tool for genetic biologists and a new approach to searching for information the project was a collaboration between researchers at the institute for genomic biology and the department of computer science led by bruce schatz professor and head of medical information science at the u of i and affiliate professor in computer science the team described the software and its applications in the web server issue of the journal nucleic acids research the research team also included cs faculty members chengxiang zhai and saurabh sinha illinois computer science affiliate professor bruce schatz when biologists need information about a gene or its function they turn to curators who keep and organize vast quantities of information from academic papers and scientific studies a curator will extract as much information as possible from the papers in his or her collection and provide the biologist with a detailed summary of what s known about the gene its location function sequence regulation and more by placing this information into an online database such as flybase the question was could you make an automatic version of that which is accurate enough to be helpful schatz said schatz and his team developed beespace navigator a free online software that draws upon databases of scholarly publications the semantic indexing to support the automatic curation used the cloud computing testbed a national computing datacenter hosted at u of i while beespace originally was built around literature about the bee genome it has since been expanded to the entire medline database and has been used to study a number of insects as well as mice pigs and fish the efficiency of beespace navigator is in its specific searches a broad general search of all known data would yield a chaotic myriad of results the millions of hits generated by a google search for example but with beespace users create spaces or special collections of literature to search it also can take a large collection of articles on a topic and automatically partition it into subsets based on which words occur together a function called clustering the first thing you have to do if you have something that s simulating a curator is to decide what papers it s going to look at schatz said then you have to decide what to extract from the text and then what you re going to do with what you ve extracted what service you re going to provide the system is designed to have easy ways of doing that the user friendly interface allows biologists to build a unique space in a few simple steps utilizing sub searches and filters for example an entomologist interested in the genetic basis for foraging as a social behavior in bees would start with insect literature then zero in on genes that are associated in literature with both foraging and social behavior a specific intersection of topics that typical search engines could not handle this type of directed data navigation has several advantages it is much more directed than a simple search but able to process much more data than a human curator it can also be used in fields where there are no human curators since only the most studied animals like mice and flies have their own professional curators schatz and his team equipped the navigator to perform several tasks that biologists often perform when trying to interpret gene function not only does the program summarize a gene as a curator would but it also can perform analysis to extrapolate functions from literature for example a study will show that a gene controls a particular chemical and another study will show that chemical plays a role in a certain behavior so the software makes the link that the gene could in part control that behavior beespace can also perform vocabulary switching an automatic translation across species or behaviors for example if it is known that a specific gene in a honeybee is analogous to another gene in a fruit fly but the function of that gene has been documented in much more detail in a fruit fly the navigator can make the connection and show a bee scientist information on the fly gene that may be helpful the main point of the project is automatically finding out what genes do that don t have known function schatz said if a biologist is trying to figure out what these genes do they re happy with anything they want to get as much information as possible the project included the work of several cs students now alumni including qiaozhu mei jing jiang xu ling xin he and david arcoleo the beespace navigator now in its fourth version is available free online overview documentation is available as well the national science

and information technology and is given to acm members with at least years of professional experience who have achieved significant accomplishments or have made a significant impact on the computing field illinois computer science professor chengxiang zhai professor zhai s research spans several related fields including information retrieval natural language processing machine learning data mining and bioinformatics his primary research interest is developing techniques for managing and exploiting large amounts of text information such as news articles email messages scientific literature government documents and all kinds of web pages with the dramatic growth of online information we are overwhelmed with huge amounts of information and have an urgent need for powerful software tools to help manage and make use of it explains zhai i work on a variety of general techniques for searching filtering organizing and mining text information and develop applications in multiple domains including web email and literature zhai and his team are tackling the problem from a variety of angles from personalized search to text mining and information retrieval solutions that better enable task support and decision making capabilities personalized search solutions one of the projects that zhai is working on is the user centered adaptive information retrieval ucair system which currently works with the yahoo search engine the software is able to learn what you are interested in and pushes out the recommended information the next time you search ucair naturally optimizes search results for you without requiring extra effort on users it learns your information need based on your search history and through observing how you search says zhai for instance if a user types in the word jaguar in a query the search results are going to contain mixed results with jaguar cars and jaguar cats if the user clicks on the car search results the software saves the information and adapts immediately to the user s interest by pushing away the animal search results as the user continues to view more search results says zhai a significant advantage of the ucair system over other personalized search systems such as google s personalized search is that the system helps protecting a user s privacy by sitting on the user s own computer the ucair demo system is available at http sifaka cs uiuc edu ir proj ucair download html professor zhai currently partners with surf canyon a technology company that uses semantic real time implicit personalization to improve search result relevancy the technology developed initially in zhai s lab works by re ranking search results on the fly based on a user model generated from real time selections the primary goal is to use more user information to assist the user in finding relevant information that s buried within the often overwhelming amount of search results zhai and his students continue to work with surf canyon to extend the technology and develop new features the long term vision of the ucair project is to develop an intelligent personal search agent that sits on the client side integrates information around a user and provides highly personalized and optimized information service to people which can eventually go beyond search toward task support collaborative and social surfing another project zhai is working on is collaborative and social surfing with a multi resolution topic map the current search engines support querying well with only limited support for browsing however when a user can t formulate effective queries as often happens in exploratory search browsing can be very useful zhai and his students have developed techniques to organize search logs into a large scale multi resolution topic map to guide a user in browsing into relevant information without needing to formulate a query in the same way as a geographic map is used to guide people in finding attractions when touring a city to view a demo about browsing with a topic map go to http sifaka cs uiuc edu ir proj csurf both the queries entered and the web pages viewed by users can be regarded as information foot prints left by users in surfing the information space the topic map organizes these foot prints as a map so future users can follow previous users foot prints more users means more effective browsing achieving the effect of collaborative surfing says zhai when combined with a social network such a topic map can also support social surfing where users can potentially see and follow the footprints of their friends combining search and social networks is a major direction that zhai and his students are currently working on aiming at connecting users with the right information at the right time as an example of this work they have recently developed a news recommender application on facebook facebook users register a community by providing a keyword description and a set of news sources the system then fetches the news articles and filters them based on the community description to prepare daily news digest to view the demo and learn more about the facebook project go to http sifaka cs uiuc edu ir proj rec aiding decisions search is a means not an end people generally search information to perform a task or make a decision zhai s work in text data mining is aimed at helping users harness information in order to make decisions data mining is already used on websites such as ebay

were among the elite graduate and postdoctoral women invited to the rising stars of eecs workshop at the massachusetts institute of technology last month the participants were made up of students at the top of their respective subfields of electrical engineering and computer science all nominated by faculty members and the event brought them together to discuss research and the steps into and throughout an academic career four women from illinois attended the rising stars in eecs workshop from left hyojin sung yemaya bordain katherine kim and yafang tan photo courtesy of patricia a sampson mit eecs the caliber of the participants was manifest the first day during research presentations which were exclusively given by students topics ranged from microfluidics to lossy data compression from magnetic resonance imaging to explanatory text analysis i was absolutely blown away by some of the presentations there said graduate student yemaya bordain one of three ece students selected for the workshop i thought are you already a faculty member how d you sneak in here in part the presentations provided a networking opportunity for the students many of whom are bound for faculty careers it helped me broaden my sense of how my research can contribute to the general field and the benefits of collaborating with people in very different fields said katherine kim an ece graduate student who presented her research on hot spot fault detection for solar panel systems developed with professor philip krein if i am ever colleagues with any of these people i will be ecstatic some collaborations and exchanges even began there at the workshop bordain s research pertains to innovative probing techniques for atomic force microscopy conducted under the direction of assistant professor gang logan liu there was another participant who had encountered a roadblock using the same kind of microscopy she had a problem that she did not know how to solve so i was able to offer her advice on a solution those interactions made it even more rewarding there were also opportunities to interact with junior faculty members and discuss the challenges of establishing a research laboratory while also maintaining a healthy balance with other responsibilities you need to know which is more important than others and also you need to learn how to offer help smartly and effectively ece graduate student yafang tan reflected on the conversation that was a sentence that had been mentioned many many times not to be overwhelmed by too many duties but meanwhile to smartly manage your load tan researches with professor brian cunningham and presented on nanoscale fabrication for biosensors the junior faculty members also exemplified alternative career paths including one who had previously worked in industry people say when you go to industry it s very hard to come back to academia because you cannot really publish said cs graduate student hyojin sung who is researching parallel computer architecture with cs professor sarita adve but the faculty member stressed that academic potential was not simply a matter of publication what really matters is that your paper has an impact on the community not how many papers or where you are publishing from sung said the students participated in workshop courses that addressed the arc of a faculty career from formulating a mission statement and giving job talks to the prerequisites for faculty promotions and tenure many faculty preparation workshops emphasize how to do your application how to get into the job but not what to do once you get in kim said tenure is about five or seven years down the line and it helps to know what to expect each of the students pointed out that while the workshop comprised only female graduate students and postdocs many of the issues facing young faculty members are universal regardless of gender i don t think it s really more specific to females because everyone has these concerns tan said as these women begin their professional careers perhaps as faculty members at leading institutions there is no doubt that the rising star metaphor will hold true i am most honored to have met these other women and to now interact with them and watch where they go in their careers bordain said i think that might have been the best part of it for me media contacts media

in the computing field these individuals have helped to enlighten researchers developers practitioners and end users of information technology throughout the world these new acm fellows join a distinguished list of colleagues to whom acm and its members look for guidance and leadership in computing and information technology sarita adve professor adve was honored for her impact on hardware and language memory models and contributions to low power and resilient systems adve s research in computer architecture and systems parallel computing and power and reliability aware systems focuses on a full systems view and is notable for its multidisciplinary collaborations illinois computer science professor sarita adve adve s broadest impact has been in hardware and software memory consistency models she received the sigarch maurice wilkes award for this work specifically for formalization of memory consistency models especially data race free models and their influence on both hardware and high level languages the memory consistency model lies at the heart of the semantics of any threaded software or hardware arguably it has been one of the most challenging and contentious areas in concurrent hardware and software specification for many years there is finally now a convergence in both the hardware and software communities adve has been the a common thread and a leader in the multiple community scale efforts that have driven this convergence the memory consistency model is a hardware software interface affecting programmability and performance unfortunately designing a model satisfying all desirable properties has proven difficult sequential consistency is simplest to program but most systems do not provide it for performance reasons instead we had divergent models often ambiguously specified for different hardware adve s early work departed from the prevalent hardware centric approaches to use a combined hardware software view more appropriate for an interface she observed that for well synchronized programs which she formalized as data race free both sequential consistency and high performance can be provided she developed a comprehensive framework to specify memory models as providing sequential consistency for data race free programs adve s data race free model forms the foundation of the memory models for java and c adve has been a leader in power and reliability aware architectures her group was among the first to recognize that significant power reductions required breaking traditional system boundaries in favor of a collaborative cross layer system wide power management framework the grace project she led was the first to demonstrate a prototype system where the hardware operating system network and applications all adapted collaboratively to minimize energy while still meeting real time quality of service requirements more recently adve has worked on hardware resiliency adve s research group along with industrial collaborators was the first to propose microarchitectural low cost techniques for lifetime reliability her recent swat software anomaly treatment project has developed a very low cost comprehensive resiliency framework that detects diagnoses and recovers from a variety of fault types the key insight is that the hardware reliability solution need handle only the device faults that become visible to software and cause anomalous software behavior swat employs almost zero cost always on monitors to detect such software anomalies and invokes a sophisticated software driven diagnosis and recovery mechanism only in the infrequent case of fault detection swat has created significant excitement in industry e g it was featured in a forum on emerging reliability issues for the ic industry sponsored by src nist sematech swat is often credited for making software driven solutions widely accepted as a promising approach for hardware resiliency adve serves on the board of

illinois mon putting on the headset you find yourself suddenly riding a platform that takes you twenty feet in the air as you try to keep your balance or shooting at angry robots that are a menace to society or becoming a frog trying to eat bugs before they get past you or even pay a visit to the ancient assyrian palace in nimrud iraq all of this in in an immersive d environment giving the experience a sense of reality not found in standard videos steven lavalle and all of these virtual reality worlds were created by university of illinois students in cs sl virtual reality this course was taught in the spring semester by cs professor steven lavalle in fall lavalle returned to illinois following an extended leave during which he served as head scientist at oculus developer of the oculus rift virtual reality headset oculus was acquired by facebook in for billion the students in the virtual reality vr course were taught the latest technology from someone who had helped develop it vr is not new lavalle explained that the technology began in the s and there was a surge in research in it during the s but interest in vr waned because the cost of the necessary equipment was so high products like the oculus rift have changed that in this current wave of technology things have changed with a high level of quality in a low cost portable headset said lavalle virtual reality causes a lot of hype and excitement and now the barrier to entry matches that before it was unattainable you had to spend a million dollars on a system and it still wasn t very compelling after that many headsets are appearing on the market now and they are low cost and very compelling students in cs sl virtual reality demonstrated projects developed over the course of the semester the vr course focused a lot on issues of human perception and comfort one important issue is vection the perception of motion when a person s body is actually stationary if you ve ever been stuck in traffic before and a truck starts moving and you might feel like you are moving backwards that s an example of vection said lavalle your eyes have convinced you that you re moving backwards and it is sometimes uncomfortable entering into a virtual world with goggles on and seeing movement the brain is receiving contrasting information the eyes tell the brain that the body is in motion but other parts of the body tell the brain that the body is stationary too much of this can cause discomfort or even motion sickness it is interesting how many small things can cause nauseousness said thomas reese ms cs one of the students in the course professor lavalle taught us throughout the semester just how much the brain auto corrects our world in order to cope developers have to augment reverse and override many of our brain s perceptions in order to make vr a comfortable experience lavalle explained we made this course with very strong perceptual psychology human factors content we look at the physiology of human vision and a little bit of neuroscience these kinds of things need to be fused into the engineering of virtual reality systems i think that makes the course very unique and provides principles that survive the test of time nathan handler bs cs said cs sl provided me with my first real experience developing for virtual reality in class we got to learn from oculus s head scientist about the science behind making a pleasant and enjoyable virtual reality interface we then had the opportunity to practice what we learned by creating our own virtual reality worlds for the oculus as homework handler said that while developing a vr world was relatively simple and straightforward creating an application that provides an enjoyable experience while takes full advantage of everything virtual reality has to offer is a much more challenging task one vr project measured head movements as the participants saw themselves rising on a platform the students in the course created projects mostly in teams of three or four students many of them were game related which fits into the typical use of video consoles the vr balance project with the risinn platform would be used particularly for older adults whose balance reflexes could be markedly different from those of younger people the students measured head movements as participants tried to maintain their balance while they experience the virtual elevation of the platform more head movements would indicate more balance issues this project was designed with the help of professor manuel hernandez from kinesiology the vr museum project recreating the assyrian palace of nimrud was done with the help of professor kesh kesavadas of industrial and enterprise systems engineering and with data came from learning sites inc and assistance from its ceo donald sanders so while many projects were game based the uses of vr can move beyond that this is not about a platform for video games said lavalle and the interest in students and researchers across campus has been growing in addition to the kinesiology research aspects lavalle has heard from faculty from such areas as business linguistics nuclear engineering psychology and neuroscience who see potential uses in their fields for this technology as the course continues to develop lavalle wants it to accommodate the growing interest in vr technology he has seen across

new teaching methods and curricular innovation in fields of interest to the ieee education society illinois computer science professor craig zilles the mac van valkenburg early career teaching award winner professor zilles teaching excellence has already been recognized twice with major teaching awards by the college of engineering and he has been on the campus wide list of teachers ranked as excellent by their students in all of the semesters that he has taught the undergraduate course as well but professor zilles biggest claim to fame comes from the praise of his students i definitely cannot say enough about professor zilles and his class his excellence in teaching not only made my job as a student much easier but more importantly ensured that i learned a lot was consistently engaged in class and was excited about going to class every week said cs alumnus james commons professor zilles was more than just a good professor he was one of the best teachers that i have ever had in my three years on campus at the university of illinois on any given day professor zilles can be found sprinting to the lecture hall ten minutes early with lecture handouts in hand to class professor zilles passion and zeal for teaching the material is evident he utilizes multiple teaching methods so that students with different learning capacities can understand the information and revised the curriculum to bring new research developments as well as his own teaching principles and innovations into the classroom i see the inherent beauty of computer science and engineering and want to share this with my students and present these ideas in a way that is relevant to my students i am inspired by teaching large classes it enables me to touch so many and makes it worth investing my time to develop new and better ways of teaching says professor zilles despite the fact the large class size course enrollment is regularly between to students professor zilles has introduced innovative methodologies to improve learning zilles utilizes in class examples problem solving sessions discussion sections one of which he teaches and interactive tutorials to keep students engaged in this required course his lecture handouts are known for featuring try it yourself problems to think about and discuss prior to lecture according to his students his thoroughness and organization don t end when lecture is over throughout the entire course he makes sure that no student s questions go unanswered by distributing full solutions for every single problempresented in the course including exams homework and discussion section problems said computer science senior melisa kudeki about halfway through the semester many students were having trouble understanding how to translate c to mips and mips to c explains cs alumnus gavin rehkemper in response to this professor zilles went above and beyond his duty he made multiple videos explaining the process and posted them which allowed us to go through the process multiple times yielding a much better understanding of the material zilles innovated a highly anticipated end of semester competition known as spimbot during spimbot students form groups and program a robot entirely in mips assembly to compete with other robots to grab tokens solve sudoku puzzles and gain directions to the next target outsmarting opposing bots the competition brings together concepts from every part of the course his competition has been adopted by instructors at other institutions as well cs provides students with a mental model of how assembly language programs are executed on computer hardware and introduces students to the organization and performance analysis of modern computers this subject matter is important for an in depth understanding of the inner workings modern computers and tradeoffs between computer hardware and software amidst all this hard work professor zilles has also made time for research and publishing it should come as no surprise that he has written eight papers in education focused engineering and computer science venues his genuine care for students as individuals has led him to make valuable contributions to improving undergraduate education across the cs department outside the classroom professor zilles regularly attends departmental functions for students and also serves as an academic advisor he is known for his willingness to explain things and approachability outside of the classroom in fact he has been named an outstanding advisor by the college of engineering for three of the last four academic years nominations for this award come from the student body i genuinely care about my students which motivates me to do my best and they recognize that fact students

torrellas kim and teodorescu were awarded million over years in three phases phase of the grant which totals k began in october a project led by illinois computer science professor josep torrellas has been chosen to receive million from darpa to explore how to improve power efficiency in embedded computer systems the year long project is being funded under the power efficiency revolution for embedded computing technologies perfect program darpa s bid to attain an efficiency of gigaflops watt for such systems chances are high that you used or relied on an embedded system today they are found in an increasing number of places from consumer electronics such as smartphones tablets and wireless readers to traffic signals industrial controls remote sensors and in military applications like surveillance and reconnaissance however with typical power efficiencies hovering around gigaflops watt the capabilities of current systems can be limited illinois computer science professor josep torrellas gains in efficiency would mean a longer battery life for mobile devices a lower cost of operation and the ability to operate at higher clock speeds without a sophisticated cooling system additionally greater power efficiency would mean that more devices or computations can be run simultaneously in situations where the peak available electrical power is limited to a set amount such as in the u s military s ground and unmanned aerial vehicles increasing the overall computational capability of the system it is no wonder that researchers have continuously sought to improve the power efficiency of embedded devices professor torrellas in cooperation with professor nam sung kim university of wisconsin and professor radu teodorescu ohio state university will investigate an integrated approach to boost energy efficiency by mitigating and tolerating parameter variations at near threshold voltage ntv a region where supply voltage is only slightly higher than threshold voltage their three phase project parameter variation at near threshold voltage the power efficiency versus resilience tradeoff started in october with dedicated to phase lowering a chip s supply voltage would significantly increase power efficiency but when supply voltage is too low transistors and other semiconductor devices perform poorly in particular they suffer from parameter variations deviations of process voltage and temperature values from nominal specifications conventional ways to handle parameter variations are not sufficient for core ntv chips manufactured on aggressive technologies such as nm current approaches are too timid and lack scalability to be truly effective says torrellas in part this is because current approaches largely focus on a single layer of the computing stack assuming worst case behavior for the other layers to rectify this weakness the researchers proposed method relies on the synergistic operation of several novel aggressive techniques that cut across the technology circuits architecture and runtime layers this approach promises a substantial improvement over current power efficiency allowing them to reach the program s goal of gigaflops watt for nm technologies in addition to the positive impact their work is expected to have on military systems torrellas kim and teodorescu s advancements will provide for a number of technologies transferable to other sectors of industry commerce and research in the first year alone at illinois torrellas intends to develop a novel variation tolerant architecture of a highly power efficient clustered many core chip intel corporation has already expressed its intention to use the researchers new models and architectures in advanced systems when it is beneficial according to torrellas grants like this one provide excellent cutting edge opportunities for illinois graduate students since students conduct most of the research and development work on these projects the experience that our students gain

language learning app created by cs grad student thomas reese was the winning project of the cozad new venture competition in the non university funded projects category thomas reese giving his presentation during the final round of the cozad new ventures competition reese has long had an interest in languages he studied abroad in hong kong as an undergraduate where he became interested in learning chinese in less than two years he became fluent that experience made him interested in how to improve the language learning experience he saw the smorgasbord of software and apps currently available but he often found them lacking hackathons pave the way reese had not really engaged in any language software since he developed a small program for spanish in high school then in he had an inspiration for a new type of language learning software that he prototyped at the inaugural hackillinois in this hackathon was where an initial primitive version of flipword emerged winning the most technically challenging prize that was the start of everything reese said flipword is an application that is installed in a browser on any visited webpage flipword changes a few words that appear into the foreign language the user is learning for example the word cat would appear as the spanish equivalent of the word gato throughout a page hovering the mouse over the new word would reveal the english learning a foreign language becomes a more regular and passive activity unfortunately even though it worked as intended flipword was painfully slow it could take anywhere from a few seconds to thirty seconds for each page to fully load reese said thirty seconds is an excessive wait for a webpage so reese put the project aside for several months in fact then in november reese had a eureka moment suddenly thinking of an approach that would dramatically increase the speed of the page loading making it a more viable product reese began attending hackathons regularly to provide concentrated time when he could work on modules of his language learning tool the goal was to work on a new piece every weekend that would eventually grow into the bigger vision he said for each hackathon i used a completely unique code base but in the end they can be pulled together under one roof and his work has been paying off reese and the teammates he finds to help him with his hackathon projects have started regularly winning prizes many within the past month at hackillinois reese developed a verbal conversation partner in the form of a cute polar bear named snowy this earned the best use of google prize just a few weeks later he teamed up with cs undergraduate joseph milla and jeffery huang at vandyhacks in nashville tennessee to create one of the most complex parts of the system winning the digital reasoning award once again paired up with milla reese and milla won the campus hackathon held april in chicago with their project languallama languallama was developed to enable language learners to have a conversation with a native speaker either actual or simulated at madhacks reese and his teammates won the wisconsin idea prize for their project uptalk from left anil jason joseph milla oreoluwa alebiosu and thomas reese at madhacks at the university of wisconsin madison held april reese teamed up yet again with milla and added teammates oreoluwa alebiosu and anil jason to create uptalk another project to help learners speak with native speakers this hackathon was more constricted entailing just hours rather than the typical despite the shortened time the team developed four working components for uptalk a chat system for communicating with people around the world a chat bot for practicing when live speakers were unavailable a conversation game to help teach context flow in conversations and personal learning statistics and feedback to make learning more like a game with uptalk the team won the wisconsin idea prize and will be representing the university at an all expense paid trip to the global hackathon in seoul south korea july august which they are all looking forward to attending most recently reese attended redbird hacks at illinois state university april there he received the most potentially disruptive hack prize a recognition of the potential impact of his project cozad competition the cozad new venture competition encourages students to create new businesses hosted by the technology entrepreneur center this year s competition program started in january with teams submitting proposals over the course of the semester a series of workshops and presentations helped winnow down the entrants of the teams that originally applied to the competition made it to the finals where they competed for nearly in funding and in kind prizes flipword passively translates particular words on a visited web page to the equivalent word in the language the uer wants to learn on april finalists in the cozad competition held a showcase and the top six projects presented a pitch to a panel of university and industry judges having honed his project through the many hackathons and the frequent practice of delivering a business pitch from the many competitions reese was confident he did well in his final pitch nevertheless the win was an exciting one the prizes reese received are designed to help cozad

the university of illinois during his time at the university he taught and conducted research in the areas of programming languages high performance computing and educational technology he served as director of undergraduate programs from to sam kamin when i was an undergraduate i read about lambda calculus and functional programming and i thought that was the coolest thing said kamin recently he has been working on run time program generation a way to optimize programs using information not available until run time it s really a direct outgrowth of my interest in functional programming he explained functional languages are great for writing generators so it s a fun kind of programming plus i ve learned a lot about modern computer architectures during the time kamin served as director of undergraduate programs he led a reevaluation of the computer science curriculum it was during that process that cs programming studio was designed and launched in this course students give and receive critiques on programs they and their classmates have written that is not typically done in computer science courses where programs are graded primarily on whether or not they work students rarely if ever get detailed critiques of their programs or read other programs kamin said so naturally they always wonder am i doing this the way i m supposed to be doing it the studio gives them the chance to calibrate where they are in terms of programming skills and improve those skills for many students it makes a big difference in their level of confidence kamin became interested in educational technology while serving as undergraduate program director he has been focusing on a project called students learn in collaborative environments slice it s a framework for programming tablets for classroom use explained kamin in one application of the framework several tablets are distributed to students and the classwork that those students do can be seen and discussed by the rest of the class this approach benefits both the instructor and the rest of the students i can get an idea of what they re not understanding he said and it s helpful for students to see that other students are making the same mistakes the course with which kamin has been most closely associated is cs programming languages and compilers previously cs programming language principles like everything else in cs this course has changed significantly over the years we used to teach functional programming as an exotic idea that students should know a bit about when covering compilers dynamically typed languages were barely mentioned now the programming world has largely boiled down to a mixture of object oriented and functional styles dynamically typed languages have exploded in popularity and virtual machines are ubiquitous it s a challenge to teach students all they need to know just to understand what s actually going on over the course of his time at illinois kamin has seen a lot of changes to the department beyond the obvious facilities changes i e the siebel center kamin said that the most obvious change was in the field of computer science itself half of what we do in research just didn t exist as a topic when i first joined the department he said security was in its infancy we didn t have data mining we didn t have hci so there are a lot of new topics and it s being involved in these developing research areas and being around other people who help create these new research areas that kamin will miss about the department the great thing about being in a place like this is that as a professor you have a lot of freedom to pursue these interests he said it s finding yourself in a position where anything you want to know about regarding computers you can just walk down the hall and find someone who s a renowned expert following his retirement from the department kamin will move to new york city to be closer to family but he doesn t plan to put the computer science world behind him i d like to do something in the same space either educational technology or programming languages or compilers he said i ve taught a lot of subjects and hopefully learned a few things and i want to continue learning and putting my knowledge to work media contacts media inquiries may be directed to tom moone associate director of communications moone at illinois

both the business and technology news pages excitedly announced facebook s billion acquisition of oculus vr the maker of a virtual reality gaming headset called oculus rift cs professor steve lavalle demoed his oculus rift technology to students during a recent visit back to campus imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online but entire experiences and adventures stated facebook s mark zuckerberg as he explained the reasoning behind the acquisition after games we re going to make oculus a platform for many other experiences imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face to face just by putting on goggles in your home illinois alumnus and cs professor steve lavalle phd ee has a special insight into the development of the new virtual reality vr technology i realized when i tried the oculus vr prototype that it cleverly leveraged the latest hardware that exists thanks to the smart phone industry explained lavalle who has been leading oculus r d efforts as its head scientist since taking leave from the university in september at that time oculus comprised only a handful of people working from their homes and they had just successfully completed their kickstarter run they reached out to me because my free on line book contains material that they needed to get started with head tracking i loved their passion and was impressed with the first prototype that they showed me i was convinced right away that the technology had finally arrived to realize the vr dream of the s by using mems sensors and high resolution screens from these devices palmer luckey the company s year old founder showed that they could be rearranged to make a vr experience that is low cost and highly immersive as noted in the company s blog lavalle has been leading research and development on some of the toughest vr challenges including sensor fusion magnetic drift correction and kinematic modeling i started by developing head tracking methods and broadened my activities over time to include work on perceptual psychology computer vision sensor calibration health and safety automated testing and optics lavalle said participating in the transition from research to development to a commercial product has been extremely valuable he noted the research we do in academia has tremendous potential for impact but it is also high risk and with a long time horizon to make an effective product simple and highly robust solutions are needed if this is not possible then perhaps the technology is not ready yet the product must be extremely reliable and cost effective which are criteria that are often at odds with pure research goals anna yershova a cs alumna and oculus research scientist helps cs professor gerald dejong try out the oculus rift hd prototype during his time at oculus lavalle has worked side by side with his wife and cs illinois alumna anna yershova phd computer science whose own research interests include robotics motion planning and computational geometry in addition two computer science students max katsev and dan gierl transitioned from working at lavalle s robotics lab at illinois to working as interns at oculus although it started as and continues to be a device that enables highly immersive gaming experiences oculus vision is to be the next great platform or medium to experience all sorts of content the possibilities are endless lavalle remarked you can experience live panoramas from anywhere in the world while being able to turn your head and even take in live localized audio take a virtual trip abroad attend a live symphony or have front row seats at the world series you can now watch existing movies in a virtual movie theater but the next step is to immerse you into the story this poses exciting new challenges for artists and cinematographers now consider what kinds of social interaction are possible with millions of people immersed into virtual worlds much more is possible but hard to predict the most exciting transformations that this technology will make on society are yet to be envisioned i expect this to come from young creative artists engineers and scientists i have been fortunate to be in an environment where i am always learning and interacting with extremely smart people over the years i have been able to both deepen my scientific background and broaden my collaborations this has made me aware of cultural issues in research communities and technology fields that often cause people to become stuck i have therefore learned to identify problems from unusual angles and fundamentally question common beliefs this has been extremely valuable in helping to shape the future of technology

has been awarded to develop a final proposal a national competition open to graduate and undergraduate engineering students from accredited engineering programs the cimit prize for primary healthcare competition seeks ideas for technologic innovations with great potential to support and catalyze improved delivery of healthcare at the frontlines of medicine from left illinois cs phd students maurice rabb yun young lee and nicholas chen the team nicholas chen yun young lee and maurice rabb are all conducting their ph d research in software engineering with professor ralph johnson the group was inspired to enter the health care it competition following a course in healthcare infrastructure cs hi taught by computer science affiliate professor bruce schatz and dr richard berlin the course focused on the ways in which a decentralized infrastructure for health care might have the same impacts on health delivery that evolved from innovations like the automobile and telephones namely empowering individuals to provide the inputs previously only provided by a centralized operator schatz is the head of the department of medical information science in the college of medicine who is using his office in siebel center to write the first book on healthcare infrastructure based on the course and interactions with computer science students cs hi instructors dr richard berlin of carle foundation hospital and cs affiliate professor bruce schatz prof schatz and dr berlin really inspired us computer science students to apply the same sense of scalability to healthcare as we are accustomed to applying to it remarked rabb during the course the group teamed together for the final course project inspired by the stereotypical life of a graduate student one high in stress and low on sleep exercise or healthy eating the team set out to monitor their daily habits using mobile devices readily available the team created tracking methods for their sleep and exercise patterns took weekly stress questionnaires and took photographs of all of the food they ate during a week period the food photographs proved to be a novel way of tracking eating habits the team took concepts from the japanese goshiki tradition extolling the virtues of eating colors of food with every meal at first the results were amusing said the team but then we really could see a pattern between how we lived and how we felt and it motivated them to change their own eating sleeping and exercising behaviors so the team turned their class project into a proposal for the cimit competition the proposal focuses on broadening the data pool available to primary care providers by making it simple for health care consumers to monitor their health and wellness inputs each day current primary healthcare suffers from the single feature single point of failure syndrome explains the team typically our vital signs are measured only when we visit a primary care facility even when measured they represent only a partial snapshot of our everyday health failing to capture the continuous spectrum of our lives yet our general health is affected by our everyday lifestyle choices the team s proposal aims to create the software tools and mobile monitoring infrastructure that will aid in both data collection and analysis of the monitoring data collected the team s approach uses readily available inexpensive devices to continuously instrument and integrate a breadth of lifestyle aspects our goal is to leverage existing technologies so that any ordinary person can make use of what we ve done to improve their health said rabb working with their proposed infrastructure hands on for weeks gave the group an excellent idea of what the daily issues and challenges are and a better sense for how to create software to help people while being minimally intrusive in their daily lives in creating their proposal the team worked closely with schatz and berlin on the healthcare infrastructure side johnson on the software engineering elements and computer science professor karrie karahalios an expert in human computer interaction and mediated communication they also had the benefit of the advice of brant chee a phd student in library and information science who had also taken the healthcare infrastructure course and was a cimit finalist the previous year health care informatics as a field is emergent right now and illinois is at the forefront said rob a rutenbar head of the computer science department and the abel bliss professor of engineering the collaborative environment at illinois is leading to some very innovative ideas in terms of the future of health care delivery and health care informatics the team and mentor schatz have submitted a paper on their work to the american medical informatics association the major professional society in this discipline while refining their proposal for the final competition the team is also creating additional tools to assist them in launching the project if they are selected as one of the winners to have their projects funded for the grand prize of currently the team is working closely with staff at bevier caf the campus caf run by the food science and human nutrition department as a course taught by jill craft north to build a photographic database of foods to aid in their analysis of diet by working directly with the bevier staff

prices and reputation it ll take you a few minutes of effort to sift through search engine results looking for relevant information as soon as a year from now computer science professor kevin chang s work could be making that task faster and far simpler for you that s the vision of his augmented reality information search engine arise project s efforts to seamlessly mash up the real world and the virtual world of the internet bridging the divide between the physical world around us and the internet s vast collection of information about that physical world illinois computer science professor kevin chang the arise project is funded by the advanced digital sciences center adsc a research center led by faculty from the university of illinois at urbana champaign and funded by singapore s agency for science technology and research kevin chang is an associate professor of computer science at the university of illinois chang observes that right now our experiences of the physical world and the internet are largely separate from each other suppose you are introduced to professor chang and want to learn more about his work you go home and sit down in front of your computer and open your browser if you want to look for the kevin chang you just met today you search for kevin chang and unfortunately this is a common name you ll find at least five different kevin changs just in computer science so now you have to determine which pages are actually about the kevin chang you just met furthermore your information needs may not be satisfied simply by finding one or two major sources of information on him such as his official home page perhaps you d also like to see the web pages of his former students information on where he s going to present talks or copies of his publications posted in digital libraries such information could be scattered across many sites around the web at heart the problem is that in the real world you may know of a single entity such as a particular restaurant called bombay grill or a particular person called kevin chang but the information available on the internet is not currently mapped to those real world entities instead search engines like google force users to handle the internet s content in a page by page manner potentially requiring users to visit large numbers of separate sites in order to gather enough information on the entity they want to learn about as prof chang explains the real question is we are living in the real world how can you find information in the way you see the real world without having to go through the laborious work of collecting and disambiguating knowledge basically we re dealing with reorganizing the whole web the main goal he wants to achieve with arise is a database of entities that we see in the real world compiled from the huge collection of pages available on the internet the first step will be an entity search process that reviews the millions of web pages that exist and determines which ones actually refer to for example kevin chang or the bombay grill and not just any kevin chang or bombay grill but particular kevin changs or bombay grills that are understood to be different entities despite having the same names this process will start by seeking out directories such as lists of faculty or listings of local restaurants such databases will be used as a starting point for anchoring the content on the web additional searching will then identify additional content that may be much more interesting such as restaurant customer reviews and apply ways to determine with a certain level of confidence whether a particular page actually contains a reference to the particular instance of kevin chang or bombay grill that is being sought second once the relevant information has been located it must be integrated together in some way that makes it easy to review the information may come from a wide variety of different websites may be written in different ways and may be talking only about certain aspects of the real world entity of interest the arise project is looking at ways to organize large amounts of material into a database that will serve as an enabling layer grouping relevant material in useful ways for example restaurant information could in effect be organized as a table with columns for price menu parking user ratings and other interesting attributes of restaurants users could then choose which type of information is desired to view results that are specific to their needs the amount of information that is available is overwhelming says chang and it is not going to decrease we are going to produce more and more with the growth of technology we are taking more pictures doing more recordings so we really want to help users by making this information more organized he anticipates that the arise technology will be most useful when used with mobile devices by users who are on the go leveraging the information available on the internet to facilitate real world experiences for example users could use the system to comparison shop while standing in a bricks and mortar store by checking product reviews or competitors prices

contains a whole genome yet the data packed into a few dna molecules could fill a hard drive as more people have their dna sequenced that data will require massive computational and storage capabilities beyond anything previously anticipated says a new assessment from computational biologists and computer scientists at the university of illinois and cold spring harbor laboratory carl r woese institute for genomic biology faculty members cs professor saurabh sinha left gene robinson a professor of entomology and igb director and their colleagues warn that genomics data will likely surpass other big data in scale photo by l brian stauffer the team of experts compared data needs of genomics with three of the biggest players in big data astronomy twitter and youtube they projected growth in each area through the year and found that genomics is poised to be a leader in data acquisition storage distribution and analysis the team s assessment is published in the journal plos biology as genome sequencing technologies improve and costs drop we are expecting an explosion of genome sequencing that will cause a huge flood of data said gene robinson a professor of entomology and the director of the carl r woese institute for genomic biology at illinois the only way to handle this data deluge will be to improve the computing infrastructure for genomics astronomy twitter and youtube represent three diverse domains that generate and use a huge amount of data albeit with huge differences in computing needs the diversity of these three forms of big data provides an excellent framework for comparative analyses with genomics he said like youtube and twitter genomics data are highly distributed coming from many different sources however both twitter and youtube have standard formats for their entries while genomic data can assume many different formats making sharing and storing more complex the authors estimate that the genomics information so far from sequencing different organisms and a number of humans has produced data on the petabyte scale a petabyte is a million gigabytes however over the last decade genomic sequencing data doubled about every seven months and will grow at an even faster rate as personal genome sequencing becomes more widespread the researchers estimate that by genomics data will explode to the exabyte scale billions of gigabytes this surpasses even youtube the current title holder among the domains studied for most data stored yet the sequences are only one element of genomic data the dna sequence in itself is not particularly useful for realizing all the great possibilities that genomics technology promises said co author and cs professor saurabh sinha the sequence data have to be analyzed through sophisticated and often computationally intensive algorithms which find patterns in the data and make connections between those data and various other types of biological information before they can lead to biologically or clinically important insights all of this makes the goal much more challenging than just sequencing dna and storing that information the need for complex analysis is similar to astronomy but with an important difference the authors say astronomy generates vast amounts of data but incorporates several processing technologies at the time of data collection requiring less time and computational power later on the researchers suggest that integrating similar processing methods could cut down on the storage needs for genomic data as well but there s a catch the whole genome may offer insights not yet anticipated as new understandings may emerge as more people are sequenced in the future we may have to take the hard decision of storing only the processed form and not the original and that too in heavily compressed forms to drastically reduce the storage needs sinha said the authors urge new technology development to handle the expected explosive growth in genomics data beyond what is predicted for social media and astronomy genomics will soon pose some of the most severe computational challenges that we have ever experienced robinson said if genomics is to realize the promise of having a transformative positive impact on medicine agriculture energy production and our understanding of life itself there must be dramatic innovations in computing now is the

been to a symphony knows that the beauty of the music depends on each player and section of the orchestra starting at the proper time and then ending at the proper time only when everything occurs in the proper order and in sync does the musical piece make its statement saurabh sinha all of this would be quite difficult without the work of the conductor who coordinates the piece and signals musicians when to begin and when to stop for cs professor saurabh sinha the development of life works much the same as an organism develops the genes found within the dna begin turning on and off in a particular order to have the organism develop in a particular way there s a very precise coordination of the timing and the location of genes turning on and off like a massive symphony that s coordinated with exquisite detail he said it s been an open question how this orchestration of thousands of genes happens in a precise way and in the same way from one organism to another to help answer this open question sinha who is a donald biggar willett scholar recently received a million grant from the national institutes of health to begin a four year project titled quantitative modeling of sequence to expression relationship the focus of the project will be gene regulation understanding how genes are turned on or off in a particular cell at specific times as an organism develops that process of development is a huge mystery said sinha we have a rather poor understanding of how that same dna in one cell can give birth to all the kinds of cells we have in our bodies one cell with one copy of dna from each parent is giving rise to a body in a sense sinha is interested in uncovering the conductor in the symphony of life what is the process that oversees ad coordinates the implementation of particular genes at specific times dna is made up of a series of nucleobases adenine a cytosine c guanine g and thymine t with just these four bases set in a particular sequence with dna an individual organism is able to develop fully from a single cell as sinha explained we know the alphabet of dna which is a c g and t but a lot of complex stuff is written with this alphabet and we do not know that language some parts of dna are understood the genes studies of the genomes have helped map out these portions of the dna so it is understood that particular parts of dna the genes have impact on certain areas of development but the rest of the dna which comprises a whopping ninety eight percent of the human dna is not genes said sinha in fact a lot of it is dedicated to controlling the activity of genes and how that of the dna controls the other remains a mystery a mystery that sinha will explore he hopes to reveal the actions of the conductor of this symphony of gene regulation sinha s project will use computational algorithms to model the available data on dna the data for this project come from genetic information on fruit flies provided in part by professor stas shvartsman sinha s collaborator at princeton university analysis of these data will lead sinha to be able to model how changes to a particular genomic sequence may affect the gene regulation process sinha explained we use methods that are based on biophysical principles principles of how different molecules interact with each other we encode those ideas into algorithms that can run fast and process large amounts of sequences then we use these tools to see if they can explain experimentally collected data after developing the models sinha will better be able to predict what effect a mutation even the smallest mutations may have on an organism s development our model could be able to predict the effects of even a single nucleotide mutation he said the knowledge that can be gained from research like that being undertaken by sinha could lead to the development of precision medicine there are many instances in which different medications for a similar disorder will affect patients differently precision medicine would enable doctors to examine a patient s genome and determine more accurately which particular regimen would be the most beneficial for a particular patient though the potential health benefits are exciting and though these are the basis for the nih funding his project sinha is just as excited about the basic science questions that his research could answer to me what s equally important as important as the health applications in precision medicine is the promise of these methods to answer fundamental unsolved problems of

science witnessed the first ever hackillinois event this student organized and student run event brought in students from universities and college in the midwest for a weekend of intense computer science competition and fun cs student matthew dierker was the director of the event it was his email seeking volunteers in october that initiated the creation of this event my job was to build the whole thing he said to bring people in and when they were there to put them on doing things later we were moving people to coordinating with companies and moving on to logistics and making sure we have stuff for the website it s creating the teams all that sort of thing dierker was assisted by cs students marrissa hellesen corporate director emily tran operations director sam gnesin and sanny lin media directors and alex burck systems director they also had a staff of over who participated in these various areas during the hackillinois weekend an addition volunteers assisted with the event tran described the goal of hackillinois as creating a fun atmosphere where students get a chance to collaborate with their peers to work on cool projects outside of the classroom and to use the latest and greatest technologies throughout the weekend the participants worked in teams of up to four the projects could be anything they dreamed up but the rules stated that projects had to be done during the hackillinois weekend final projects were to be submitted on sunday morning hellesen said they really just work from p m on friday night until a m on sunday morning hackillinois hosted students from universities and colleges in the midwest more than companies provided financial sponsorship of the event these companies also sent a total of representatives to the event to interact with the participants the end of hackillinois featured a project fair in which teams showcased their projects judges were cs illinois faculty and some corporate representatives on sunday the projects were judged and the top projects were announced top project honors went to teams from illinois and purdue first place went to the illinois team that created walter a news app second place to a purdue team that created clock a clock app for pebble and third to another illinois team for goq an office hours and course organizing tool also for pebble in addition some sponsoring companies gave out prizes to teams that used their products in their team projects tran said there were so many new and useful tools and apps made that meshed together technologies in ways that were brilliant though the participants in hackillinois were all computer enthusiasts they couldn t really go an entire weekend on a completely serious schedule thirty six hours is a long time dierker said so we try to get them away from their computers as well one activity that the team organized was a tour of the blue waters petascale computing facility on saturday only the most technoloigically advanced construction material would do additional diversions were provided by the moonshots a group of mostly freshmen volunteers who were given the task to add some fun to the event the moonshots decorated the siebel center and dcl brought in a photo booth organized nerf wars for the participants staff and sponsors and even had therapy dogs visit all to give the participants something to take their mind away from the computer for a time we told them we ll give you some money so do something cool with it said hellesen they just went nuts and it was great organizers are already looking forward to next year s event overall they were very pleased with how things went this first event a lot of things worked really well said dierker people enjoyed how organized everything was people s projects worked pretty well i think sponsors were happy hackillinois staff created a youtube video celebrating the successes and fun of their event the hackillinois team had three areas that they wanted to keep problem free food power and wi fi except for some small problems with the wi fi the event went smoothly this was in contrast to similar groups around the country where food ran out or power went out or wi fi proved to be a continual problem looking back over the event hellesen said that she would gladly give six months of her life to hackillinois it gets the creative juices flowing she said you take a step back and do something totally different it opens up a world of possibilities media contacts media inquiries may be directed to tom moone associate director of communications moone at illinois dot

about us faculty positions staff positions directory giving ways to give calendar twitter facebook linkedin cs store news home news movesense app makes cellphone an oxygen saturation monitor for heart and lung patients by chantelle thompson college of medicine thu patients suffering from chronic cardiopulmonary diseases could soon have a solution to help them accurately monitor their health and warn doctors at the first sign of trouble an illinois team developed a smartphone app movesense which monitors cardiopulmonary patients by analyzing the way they walk then predicts their oxygen saturation level without the use of a pulse oximeter by simply carrying their cellphone equipped with the health tracking app movesense developed by researchers at the university of illinois at urbana champaign a patient s oxygen saturation level can be passively monitored with medical accuracy oxygen saturation is a standard measure of health status the single most important clinical measure unlike other methods of measuring oxygen saturation levels which detect sharp drops causing desaturation movesense continuously monitors saturation making the resultant patterns possible to model accurately and the patient is only required to carry a smart phone while walking cs grad student qian cheng was lead author on the article that will appear in the journal telemedicine and e health the official journal of the american telemedicine association the research team is led by bruce schatz the head of medical information science at the college of medicine at urbana champaign and an affiliate professor of computer science authors included students from the college of engineering and physicians from carle foundation hospital in urbana illinois where the patient testing was performed bruce schatz the ability to accurately measure oxygen saturation without the use of a pulse oximeter is something that has never been achieved until now the oximeter a non invasive medical device usually placed on the patient s finger measures the proportion of oxygen in the blood combining status of the two major circulatory systems the heart and the lung the saturation level is an overall measure of the patient s cardiopulmonary fitness said schatz who also is affiliated with the institute for genomic biology where the data analysis was performed this medical discovery was made with the aid of findings from one of schatz s previous discoveries that revealed phone sensors can accurately measure walking patterns also known as gait doctors often use an assessment called the six minute walk test for patients with heart and lung disease such as congestive heart failure chf chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and asthma the test provides information regarding a patient s functional capacity and response to therapy for a wide range of chronic cardiopulmonary conditions the illinois team used movesense in conjunction with their existing gait model to administer six minute walk tests to patients with cardiopulmonary disease patients wore pulse oximeters so that readings could be compared to movesense data and carried smartphones running movesense software which continuously recorded saturation and motion continuous saturation defined categories corresponding to status levels including transitions this by itself was a new medical observation continuous motion was used to compute eight gait parameters from the sensor data their existing gait model was then trained with these data points and used to predict transitions in oxygen saturation the ability to accurately measure oxygen saturation without the use of a pulse oximeter is something that has never been achieved until now the pulse oximeter a non invasive medical device usually placed on the patient s finger measures the proportion of oxygen in the blood combining status of the two major circulatory systems the heart and the lung the researchers discovered oxygen saturation readings clustered patients into three pulmonary function categories one with consistently high saturation one with consistently low saturation and a third where saturation varied and patients were clinically unstable in addition they discovered that analysis of the saturation combined with the gait data could predict saturation category with percent accuracy the model uses a voting scheme to account for patients walking faster and slower as their hearts and lungs struggle to keep up with demand the ability to predict the saturation category of the patient internally from motion of the patient externally is remarkable this new capability will allow medical professionals to monitor patients vital signs predict their clinical stability and act quickly should their condition decline patients need only carry their personal phones during daily living as testing has shown that periodic samples are sufficient and that even inexpensive smartphones are powerful enough to record these given our previous success with predictive modeling of gait with chronic lung disease patients and our knowledge of the correlation between gait speed and oxygen desaturation in walk tests we knew if we could passively and continuously record oxygen saturation using a smartphone we could predict cardiopulmonary status in a medically accurate and economical way said schatz a discovery like this will impact general medicine many medical specialties and the lives of millions of people suffering from chronic cardiopulmonary diseases the u s department of agriculture supported this work in part with additional funds provided by the college of medicine at urbana champaign predicting transitions in oxygen saturation using phone sensors by qian cheng joshua juen jennie hsu lumetta and bruce schatz
